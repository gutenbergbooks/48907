<p>The fact that this little book has passed through
many editions, and now enters on a new one in
revised form, is ample answer to its writer’s prayer
when, with the aid of his Publishers, he launched
it on an uncertain voyage over the seas of time&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<h2>INTRODUCTORY </h2>


<p>In these days when the vernacular of the street
invades the home; when illiterate communications
corrupt good grammar; and when the efforts of the
teachers in the public schools are rendered ineffective
by parents careless of their diction, constant attempts
are being made to point out the way to that
“Well of English undefiled” so dear to the heart
of the purist. But, notwithstanding these efforts to
correct careless diction, the abuse and misuse of
words continue. The one besetting sin of the
English-speaking people is a tendency to use colloquial
inelegancies, slang, and vulgarisms, and against
these, as against the illiteracies of the street, it is
our duty to guard, nowadays more so than at any
other time, since what is learnt in the schoolroom is
soon forgotten or displaced by association with illiterate
playfellows, or by occasionally hearing words
misused at home.</p>

<p>Of the purely syntactical side of the English language,
no less a master of its intricacies and niceties
than Thomas Jefferson has said “I am not a
friend to a scrupulous purism of style; I readily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
sacrifice the niceties of syntax to euphony and
strength. It is by boldly neglecting the rigorisms
of grammar that Tacitus has made himself the
strongest writer in the world. The hyperesthetics
call him barbarous; but I should be sorry to exchange
his barbarisms for their wiredrawn purisms.
Some of his sentences are as strong as language
can make them. Had he scrupulously filled up the
whole of their syntax, they would have been merely
common. To explain my meaning by an English
example, I will quote the motto of one, I believe, of
the regicides, of Charles I., ‘Rebellion to tyrants is
obedience to God.’ Correct its syntax ‘Rebellion
against tyrants is obedience to God.’ It has lost
all the strength and beauty of the antithesis.” And
Jefferson continued: “Where strictness of grammar
does not weaken expression, it should be attended
to. But where, by small grammatical negligences,
the energy of an idea is condensed, or a word stands
for a sentence, I hold grammatical rigor in contempt.”</p>

<p>The English language is the most flexible language
in the world. Indeed, it is so flexible that
some of its idioms are positively startling. Could
any phrase be more so than “I don’t think it will
rain”?&mdash;Simple enough as an idiom but positively
absurd when analyzed. We say “<i>I don’t think</i> it
will rain” when we mean “I do think it will not rain.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
Again, we say “All over the world” when we should
say “Over all the world,” and “the reason why”
instead of “the reason that.” Usage has made our
language what it is; grammatical rules strive to
limit it to what it ought to be. In many instances
usage has supplanted grammatical rules. Hundreds
of words have been used by masters of English
in ways that violate these rules. These uses
are to be found to-day recorded by the dictionaries
because lexicographers recognize it is their duty to
present the language as they find it used by the
people. It is to the people, not to the purists, that
one must look for the enriching of our mother
tongue. To them it is as impossible to confine the
English language within the bonds of grammatical
rules as it is to stem the tide of the sea. For them
all matters that relate to English speech can be decided
only by the law of good usage. This, and
this alone is their Court of Last Resort. Withal,
the observance of certain conventional rules does no
harm if it helps him who speaks carelessly to produce
a refined style of diction and writing, or if it
teaches him who does not know, what to say and
how to say it.</p>

<p>The secret of strength in speech and writing
lies in the art of using the right word in the right
place; therefore, careful speakers and writers should
aim to command not only a large vocabulary but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
wide and correct knowledge of the meanings of
words. These can be most readily acquired by noting
the meaning of every new word across which
one may come in reading, and by constantly consulting
a dictionary, preferably one which compares
or contrasts words in such a manner as to bring out
clearly the finer and nicer distinctions in their meanings&mdash;such
distinctions as are necessary to the student
to put him into possession of the essential
differences of the words compared. Learn the
meaning of words and your tongue will never slip.
As Southey has said, “the greatest wisdom of speech
is to know when, and what, and where to speak;
the time, matter, and manner.”</p>

<p>The best asset in life is knowledge. Knowledge
well-grounded may be secured by the systematic
study of words. The desirability of exercising great
care not only in the selection of words, but in marshaling
them in their correct order must be apparent
to any one familiar with some of the errors committed
by writers who, notwithstanding the blunders
they have made, have acquired reputation as authors
of good English. Dr. Samuel Johnson, in his
“Lives of the Poets,” is responsible for the following
statement: “Shakespeare has not only shown human
nature as it is, <i>but as it would be found in situations
to which it cannot be exposed</i>”&mdash;a statement the absurdity
of which can not fail to impress the reader.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>In the King James Version of the Bible, quoted
by some authorities as a standard of pure English,
one may find the following, which occurs in Isaiah
xxxvii. 36: “Then the angel of the Lord went forth
and smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred
and fourscore and five thousand; <i>and when they
arose</i> early in the morning, behold <i>they were all
dead corpses</i>.” It can hardly be supposed that the
translators meant to imply that the corpses arose
early in the morning and found themselves dead.
In the second act of “Julius Cæsar,” Shakespeare
puts into the mouth of <i>Ligarius</i> the following: “I
will strive with things impossible; yea, get the better
of them.” For power of perseverance <i>Ligarius</i> is to
be commended. Hallam, author of the “Literature
of Europe,” declared that “No one as yet had exhibited
the structure of the human kidneys, Vesilius
having only examined them in dogs”&mdash;a declaration
which implies that the dog must have bolted them
whole. The London <i>Times</i> has occasionally perpetrated
absurdities which equal, if they do not surpass,
these. In an obituary announcing the death of
Baron Dowse it said, “A great Irishman has passed
away. God grant that many as great, and who shall
as wisely love their country, may follow him.” Here
the intended wish is not that many great Irishmen
may die but that there may be many to follow him
who shall love their country as well as he did. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
equally absurd example taken from an issue of the
<i>Freeman’s Journal</i> of the year 1890, announces “The
health of Mr. Parnell has lately taken a very serious
turn, and <i>fears of his recovery</i> are entertained by his
friends,” which, one may add, was rather unfriendly
on their part. Isaac Disraeli in his “Curiosities of
Literature” himself was guilty of an absurdity when
he wrote, “It is curious to observe the various substitutes
for paper <i>before its invention</i>.”</p>

<p>Errors of a different sort found their way even into
our earlier dictionaries. Cockeram defined a lynx
as “a spotted beast which hath the most perfect
sight in so much as it is said that it can see through
a wall.” The salamander he described as “a small
venomous beast with foure feet and a short taile; it
lives in the fire, and at length by its extreme cold
puts out the fire.” Both of these definitions show
the rudimentary stage of the knowledge of our forefathers
in matters zoological.</p>

<p>Of slang no less eminent a writer of English than
Richard Grant White has said, “Slang is a vocabulary
of genuine words or unmeaning jargon, used
always with an arbitrary and conventional signification,”
and because “it is mostly coarse, low, and
foolish,” certain slang terms and phrases have been
included in the following pages, together with a few
undesirable colloquialisms. These are included because
the indiscriminate use of slang leads to slov<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>enliness
in speech. Not all slang is slovenly, incorrect,
or vicious; much of it is virile, expressive,
and picturesque. It is against the spread of that
part of slang which is slovenly, incorrect, foolish, or
vicious, that one should guard.</p>

<p>The purpose of these pages is not to dictate a
precise course to be followed, nor to lay down rules
that will prevent any speaker or writer from exercising
his privilege as an individual of speaking or
writing freely and independently the thoughts that
are uppermost in his mind. It is, rather, to point out
common errors which he may unconsciously commit,
and to help him to avoid them and the vulgarisms
of the street which have crept into the language, as
well as those absurd blunders that have been recorded
as the unconscious acts of persons qualified
in other respects to rank as masters of English.
To this end, and to this end only, the following
vocabulary of errors in English has been compiled.</p>

<span class="large">A DESK-BOOK OF</span> <br />

<span class="x-large">ERRORS IN ENGLISH</span></p>




<h2 class="nobreak">A </h2>


<p><a id="a_an"></a><b>a</b>, <b>an</b>: Before an aspirated “h,” as in “Hibernianism,”
the article “a” should be used. “A” is used
when the next word begins with a consonant sound;
“an” when it begins with a vowel or silent “h.”
Though never so feebly aspirated, “h” has something
of a consonant sound, and the article in this case
ought to conform to the general principle, as in “<i>a</i>
historic introduction has generally <i>a</i> happy effect to
arouse attention.” To be correct one should say: <i>an</i>
island, <i>a</i> Highlander; <i>an</i> oysterman, <i>a</i> hoister; <i>a</i>
hotel, <i>an</i> onion; <i>a</i> herb, <i>an</i> heir; <i>a</i> house, <i>an</i> owl.
Some persons do not aspirate the “h” in “herb”;
when the “h” is not aspirated, the word takes the
article “an,” not “a.”</p>

<p><b><a id="abandon"></a>abandon</b>, <b>forsake</b>, <b>desert</b>: To <i>abandon</i> is to give up
entirely, as home and friends, and implies previous
association with responsibility for or control; to <i>forsake</i>
is to leave or withdraw from a person or place,
and suggests previous association with inclination or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
attachment. <i>Abandon</i> and <i>forsake</i> may be used in a
favorable or unfavorable sense. <i>Desert</i> is to leave
permanently and especially without regard for the
person or thing deserted; it is used only in an unfavorable
sense and usually implies a breach of
duty.</p>

<p>Some writers assert that <i>desert</i> is used only “of
causes or persons but not of things.” This is erroneous.
There is ample evidence of its correct application
to things; as the soldier <i>deserts</i> his colors;
the sailor <i>deserts</i> his ship.</p>

<p><b>abbreviate</b>, <b>abridge</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. To <i>abbreviate</i> is to shorten a
word so that a part stands for the whole; to <i>abridge</i>
is to condense or epitomize, as a report, in such
manner that the spirit of the original is retained
though it is expressed in fewer words.</p>

<p><b><a id="ability"></a>ability</b>, <b>capacity</b>: These words are not exactly
synonymous in meaning when used in the singular.
<i>Ability</i> is bodily or mental power; <i>capacity</i> is receptive
or containing power. <i>Ability</i> when used in
the plural embraces both meanings.</p>

<p><b>about</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#almost_about">ALMOST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>above</b>: Inelegantly used as a noun by ellipsis of
some noun as “He wrote the <i>above</i>,” for “the <i>above
phrase</i>.” A more objectionable use is as an adjective;
as, “I submit the <i>above</i> facts” for “I submit
the <i>above</i>-mentioned facts.” The use of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
word “foregoing” or the more legal expression
“before-mentioned” would better meet the case.
Lamb, always inclined to be humorous, ridicules
the expression by referring to “the <i>above</i> boys and
the below boys.”</p>

<p><b>above</b> should not be used for “more than.”</p>

<p><b>acceptance</b>, <b>acceptation</b>: Terms sometimes used
interchangeably but incorrectly so. “Acceptance”
is the state of being accepted; as the <i>acceptance</i> of a
position or office; <i>acceptation</i> is the favorable admission
of or acquiescence in a matter, or assent to a
belief.</p>

<p><b>accept of</b>: A visitor does not <i>accept of</i> the hospitality
of his host, but <i>accepts</i> his hospitality. In this
phrase “of” is redundant.</p>

<p><b>accident</b>, <b>injury</b>: These words are used sometimes
incorrectly. An “accident” is that which
happens without known or assignable cause or without
deliberate intention; an “injury” is a hurt that
causes physical or mental pain resulting, as from an
accident. An accident may be injurious, and injuries
painful; but accidents should never be spoken
of as painful.</p>

<p><b><a id="accord"></a>accord</b> should not be used for <i>give</i>. To <i>accord</i>
is “to render or concede as due and proper, as
honor or veneration;” to <i>give</i> is “to bestow as
appropriate; as to <i>give</i> thanks, praise, or welcome.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="accord_award"></a><b>accord</b>, <b>award</b>: The first of these words implies
a spontaneous bestowal prompted by the dictates of
the heart (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cor</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cord</i>-, heart); the concession or
grant due to inherent merit that cannot be denied.
<i>Award</i> is colder and more unimpassioned and
formal, and implies a grant only after careful observation
and judgment. You <i>accord</i> honor where
honor is individually due, but <i>award</i> a medal to
a victor out of many (actual or possible) contestants.</p>

<p><b>accord</b>, <b>grant</b>: Privileges may be either <i>accorded</i>
or <i>granted</i>. To <i>accord</i> is to concede as due and
proper; grant; bestow; allow; to <i>grant</i> is to bestow
or confer; give, as a concession; allow. Some
writers erroneously restrict the meaning of <i>accord</i> to
“agree with; suit.”</p>

<p><b>acknowledgment</b>: Do not spell this word <i>acknowledgement</i>;
preferably it is <i>acknowledgment</i>&mdash;omit “e”
after the “g.”</p>

<p><b>acme</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#climax">CLIMAX</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>acoustic</b> (<i>a.</i>), <b>acoustics</b> (<i>n.</i>): When the adjective
is used the verb must agree in number with the
noun which the adjective qualifies; as, “the <i>acoustic</i>
properties of this theater <i>are</i> good.” But the noun
though plural in form is singular in construction and
always takes a verb in the singular as, “acoustics <i>is</i>
a branch of physics.”</p>

<p><b>acquaintance</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#friend">FRIEND</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p><b>acquiesce</b>: Never use the preposition “with”
after this word. You acquiesce <i>in</i> an arrangement.</p>

<p><b>act</b>, <b>action</b>: Do not use one word for the other.
A man does a good <i>act</i> rather than a good <i>action</i>.
An <i>act</i> is accomplished by an exercise of power,
whereas an <i>action</i> is the fact of exerting such power
and refers to the <i>modus operandi</i>. A party to a conveyance
signifies his exercise of power by the
formula “This is my <i>act</i> and deed,” but the course
pursued, the procedure&mdash;the fact of sale and purchase&mdash;may
be referred to as a <i>wise action</i>.</p>

<p><b>adherence</b>, <b>adhesion</b>, <b>attachment</b>: These terms
are no longer synonymous, although originally so.
<i>Adherence</i> is used of things mental or spiritual, as
principles, while <i>adhesion</i> is applied to material
things. The figurative meaning of <i>adhere</i> appears in
<i>adherence</i>, which is somewhat synonymous with <i>attachment</i>
and applies to mental conditions or principles.
<i>Adhesion</i> is generally reserved for physical
attachment; as, “an <i>adhesion</i> effected by glue,”
although Dowden in his “Studies in Literature”
(p. 230,) has written “Browning’s courageous <i>adhesion</i>
to truth never deserts him.” Far better
is Johnson’s “Shakespeare’s <i>adherence</i> to general
nature has exposed him to the censure of critics,
who form their judgments upon narrower principles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p><b>adjective</b> and <b>adverb</b>: In selecting the correct
word to use, bear in mind that where a phrase denoting
manner can be substituted an adverb is
required; where some tense of the verb <i>to be</i> can be
used the adjective is necessary; as, “The surgeon
felt the limb <i>carefully</i> and found that one of the
bones was <i>broken</i>.”</p>

<p><b>admission</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#admittance">ADMITTANCE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>admit</b>, <b>admit of</b>: Very different in meaning.
“This gate <i>admits</i> (affords entrance) to the grounds,
but the size of the vehicle will not <i>admit of</i> (allow
or permit) its passing through.” Where Emerson
says “Every action <i>admits of</i> being outdone,” the
simple <i>admit</i> could not be substituted.</p>

<p><b><a id="admittance"></a>admittance</b>, <b>admission</b>: These words are not
merely synonymous. <i>Admittance</i> refers to place,
<i>admission</i> refers also to position, privilege, favor,
friendship, etc. An intruder may gain <i>admittance</i> to
the hall of a society who would not be allowed <i>admission</i>
to its membership.</p>

<p><b>adore</b>: Often misused as an emphatic for “like.”
One may <i>adore</i> that which one reveres or venerates
or has profound regard or affection for, but not that
which is pleasant to the palate. A child may <i>like</i>
cherries and <i>adore</i> its mother, but it does not <i>adore</i>
cherries though it <i>likes</i> its mother.</p>

<p><b><a id="advantage"></a>advantage</b>, <b>benefit</b>: Exercise care in using these
words. <i>Advantage</i> is that which gives one a vantage-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>ground,
either for coping with competitors or with
difficulties, needs, or demands; as, “to have the <i>advantage</i>
of a good education.” It is frequently used
of what one has beyond another or secures at the
expense of another; as, “to have the <i>advantage</i> of
another in an argument,” or “to take <i>advantage</i> of
another in a bargain.” <i>Benefit</i> is anything that does
one good.</p>

<p><b>adverbs and the infinitive “to.”</b> See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#split_or_cleft_infinitive">SPLIT INFINITIVE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>a few</b>. Condemned as employing the singular article
before an adjective plural in sense. Usage
sanctions <i>a hundred</i> and <i>a</i> great <i>many</i>, these expressions
being viewed as collective. <i>A few</i> is correct
idiomatic English, with a sense distinctively different
from that of the adjective used alone; as, “<i>A few</i>
men can be trusted” (<i>i. e.</i>, a small but appreciable
number). “<i>Few</i> men can be trusted” (<i>i. e.</i>, scarcely

“<i>Most</i> men are <i>not</i> to be trusted.”</p>

<p><b>against</b>: Never shorten this preposition into <i>again</i>.
Such a usage is either dialectical or obsolete; and
save in such usage there is no preposition <i>again</i>, or
as sometimes spoken by persons careless with their

<p><b><a id="aggravate"></a>aggravate</b>, <b>exasperate</b>, <b>irritate</b>, <b>provoke</b>: A fever
or a misfortune may be <i>aggravated</i>, but not a person.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The person is, perhaps, <i>exasperated</i> or <i>provoked</i>. To
<i>aggravate</i>, from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aggravo</i> “to make heavy,”
is to intensify, and applies only to conditions of
fact; <i>provoke</i>, which calls forth anger, and <i>exasperate</i>,
which heightens (or roughens) anger already
provoked, allude to mental states. A patient may
be so <i>irritated</i> that his condition is <i>aggravated</i>. Here
to <i>aggravate</i> is to make worse; to <i>irritate</i> is to annoy,
provoke.</p>

<p><b><a id="agreeable"></a>agreeable</b>: Do not spell this word <i>agreable</i>. Its
component parts are <i>agree</i> plus <i>able</i>; always double
the “e” before the “a.” <i>Agreeable</i> is often erroneously
used for <i>agreeably</i> in correspondence. In this
sense it is a commercial colloquialism, meaning
“being in accordance or conformity,” as with some
previous action. “<i>Agreeable</i> to your request I have
forwarded the goods.” Correctly, this should be
rendered “<i>Agreeably</i> with your request, etc.,” meaning
“so as to be agreeable.”</p>

<p><b>ain’t</b>: Avoid as inelegant. In such a phrase as
“he ain’t,” it is both vulgar and ungrammatical;
“he isn’t” is the preferred form. “The contraction
<i>ain’t</i> for isn’t is a vulgarism which ought not to
need criticism. Yet ‘<i>’tain’t</i> so’ said an educated
preacher once in my hearing. The safe rule re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>specting
contractions is never to use them in public

<span class="smcap">Austin Phelps</span>, <i>English Style</i>, lecture ii. p. 25.</p>

<p><b><a id="alienate"></a>alienate</b>, <b>antagonize</b>: <i>Alienate</i> which means “estrange,”
should never be used for <i>antagonize</i>, meaning
“contend against” or “bring into opposition.”
Thus, you <i>alienate</i> your friend because you <i>antagonize</i>
his views.</p>

<p><b>allege</b>: Do not spell this word <i>alledge</i>. It has no
connection whatever with <i>ledge</i>, a shelf. <i>Allege</i> is
derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">adlegio</i>, clear, and came to
England with the Normans in the Norman French
form <i lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">aligier</i>, Old French, <i lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">esligier</i>, from the Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex</i>,
out, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">litigo</i>, to carry strife. It means, to assert.</p>

<p><b><a id="alleviate"></a>alleviate</b>, <b>relieve</b>: Distinguished from relieve, as
<i>alleviate</i>, by lightening (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, to, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levis</i>, light),
mitigates or makes less burdensome, and <i>relieve</i>,
by removing (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">re</i>, again, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levis</i>, lifting up),
supplies what is wanting.</p>

<p><i>Alleviation</i> affects internal sensations, affording
comparative ease, whereas <i>relief</i> operates upon external
conditions, removing pain. You <i>alleviate</i> suffering
and <i>relieve</i> distress or poverty.</p>

<p><b>all of them</b>: This phrase furnishes an excellent
example of the common carelessness of speech. <i>Of</i>
signifies <i>from</i> or <i>from out</i>; and whereas one can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
subtract a certain quantity <i>from</i> an entire number,
one can hardly refer to that number as still existing,
in any shape whatever, if one subtracts the
whole; for <i>from out</i> implies a remainder. You may
say “ship <i>some</i>, or any definite number, say <i>ten of
them</i>,” or “ship <i>them all</i>,” but not “ship all of them.”</p>

<p><b>all over the world</b>: A common but undesirable locution
for “all the world over” or “over all the
world.”</p>

<p><b><a id="allow"></a>allow</b>, <b>permit</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Allow</i> implies no attempt at hindrance;
<i>permit</i> suggests authorization to do. One
<i>allows</i> that to which one interposes no objection or
takes no step to prevent; one <i>permits</i> that to which
one gives express consent or authorization. In
some parts of the United States <i>allow</i> is used in the
sense of “think, think likely, intend”; as, “he <i>allowed</i>
he would go”; “he <i>allowed</i> to pay it.” It is used
also in the sense of <i>say</i>. Both uses are wholly inadmissible.</p>

<p><b>all right</b>: In best usage this term is always written
as two words. Formerly <i>alright</i> was in vogue, but
it is now obsolete.</p>

<p><b>allude</b>: This word is frequently used as synonymous
with <i>mention</i>, but this is a careless and improper
treatment of the term.</p>

<p>“Allude is in danger of losing its peculiar signification,
which is delicate and serviceable.... (It) means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>

<p>Allude is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alludo</i>, treat lightly, from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, at, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludo</i>, play, and should be used only with
the sense of “to refer incidentally, indirectly, or by
suggestion.” When you toast a hero by name, you
certainly do not allude to him, although in so doing
you make a pretty allusion to the heroic act with
which his name is identified. In toasting Dewey,
you do not allude to him but to his deeds off Manila.</p>

<p><b>allusion</b>: Distinguish between this word and <i>illusion</i>.
The former is derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, at, +
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludo</i>, play (treat lightly), and means an incidental
suggestion or passing reference, a species of innuendo;
the latter is derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in</i>, on, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ludo</i>
play (play tricks on), and means an unreal image
presented to the senses.</p>

<p><b><a id="almost"></a>almost</b>: “An adjective in early English, the use of
which has recently been revived, but it has not received
the sanction of general usage.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span>.</p>

<p>An “<i>almost</i> Christian” is, however, a most expressive
term, and would oftentimes more nearly express
the truth than the absolute and unqualified “Christian.”
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#most">MOST</a></span>.</p>

<p><a id="almost_about"></a><b>almost</b>, <b>about</b>: These words are now commonly
used as interchangeable synonyms. Formerly, such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
use was condemned. One may say of a task that it
is “<i>almost</i> completed” or that it is “<i>about</i> completed”
meaning that it is nearly accomplished or
approaches closely to a completed state.</p>

<p><b>already</b>: Although this word consists of two elements
“all” and “ready,” it is not correctly spelled
with two “l’s” but <i>already</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="also"></a>also</b>, <b>likewise</b>: According to some writers <i>also</i>
merely denotes addition, and <i>likewise</i> denotes connection
with some person or thing that has previously
been referred to. <i>Likewise</i>, which means
“in like manner,” of necessity refers to states and
conditions which are susceptible of manner, and
should not be used indiscriminately for <i>also</i>, which
properly connects facts and qualities. There is, for
example, a considerable difference between the expressions
“He spoke <i>also</i>” and “He spoke <i>likewise</i>.”
In the second case, the matter of speech may be considered
to have been to the same effect as the speech
first alluded to. Lexicographers do not recognize
this difference.</p>

<p>In practise, the choice between these words is
largely to secure euphony and avoid repetition.
<i>Also</i> and <i>likewise</i> affirm that what is added is like
that to which it is added.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>,
p. 59.</p>

<p><b>alternative</b>: “This word means a choice&mdash;one
choice&mdash;between two things. Yet popular usage has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
so corrupted it, that it is now commonly applied to
the things themselves, and not to the choice between
them, as ‘You may take either <i>alternative</i>,’ ‘I was
forced to choose between two <i>alternatives</i>.’ And, indeed,
some people go so far as to say ‘several <i>alternatives</i>
were presented him.’”&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. S. Gould</span>, <i>Good
English, Misused Words</i>, p. 45.</p>

<p><b>always</b>, <b>all ways</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. <i>Always</i> means “during all time”;
<i>all ways</i> means “in every way.”</p>

<p><b><a id="amateur"></a>amateur</b>, <b>novice</b>: These terms are not synonymous.
The distinction between them is that an <i>amateur</i> may
be the equal in skill of a professional, but a <i>novice</i> is
a beginner, and as such does not equal the professional
in skill.</p>

<p><b>ambidextrous</b>: Do not spell this word “<i>ambidexterous</i>.”
It is derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dextra</i>, the
right hand, and <i>ous</i>. Although the form <i>ambidexterous</i>
was common in England in the nineteenth
century, it is not now in use.</p>

<p><b>ambition</b> should not be used to signify mild energy
as it imports persistent and inordinate or steadfast
desire. “The heat leaves me without <i>ambition</i> for
work” illustrates an altogether wrong use of the word.</p>

<p><b>amid</b>, <b>among</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>Amid</i> denotes position when one object is
surrounded by others from which it differs in nature
or characteristics; <i>among</i> denotes an intermingling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of objects of the same nature. A man may be <i>amid</i>
enemies but not <i>among</i> them; he may be <i>among</i>
friends but not <i>amid</i> them.</p>

<p><a id="among_between"></a><b>among</b>, <b>between</b>: <i>Among</i> may apply to any number;
<i>between</i> applies to two only.</p>

<p><b>among one another</b>: A pleonasm. Say, rather,
“<i>among themselves</i>.”</p>

<p><b>among the rest</b>: Say “<i>among them</i> was he,” or
“<i>with the rest</i> was he”&mdash;not <i>among the rest</i>. As “the
rest” specifically excludes himself, it is impossible
for him to figure in the midst of them.</p>

<p><b>amount</b>, <b>number</b>: <i>Amount</i> is used of substances
in mass; <i>number</i> refers to the individuals of which
such mass is constituted.</p>

<p><b>an</b>: Modern practice does not permit of the use
of <i>an</i> before words beginning with an aspirated “h”
as, “hair,” “hall,” “harangue,” “hero,” “history,”
“historical,” “historian,” “house,” “hypothesis,”
“heraldic,” etc. However, it may be correctly used
before words in which the initial “h” is not aspirated.

<p><b><a id="ancient"></a>ancient</b>, <b>antiquated</b>: Anything <i>antiquated</i> is <i>ancient</i>
but not all things that are <i>ancient</i> are <i>antiquated</i>; thus
<i>ancient</i> refers to things that existed in olden times;
<i>antiquated</i> to things obsolete or that have fallen behind
the times.</p>

<p><b>and</b>, (<b>the relative preceded by</b>): Where “and” is
used to connect two clauses the clauses must be of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
similar construction. Therefore, do not say, “I met
Florence on Wednesday, <i>and which</i> was very pleasing
to me,” which is not only grammatically incorrect,
but is faulty in that it introduces an altogether
useless word. Omit the “and.”</p>

<p><a id="and_to"></a><b>and</b>, <b>to</b>: These terms are not interchangeable.
One does not “try <i>and</i> do a task,” but “one tries
<i>to</i> do it.”</p>

<p><b>anger</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#temper">TEMPER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>angry</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#mad">MAD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>angry at</b>, <b>with</b>: A man may be angry <i>at</i> or <i>about</i>
a hurt, never <i>with</i> it; he is angry <i>at</i> rather than
<i>with</i> a dog. We may be angry <i>with</i> a person.</p>

<p><b>annoyed at</b>, <b>by</b>, <b>with</b>: Note the correct use of
the prepositions. “He will be annoyed <i>at</i> or <i>by</i>
complaints” (if they are made); “He will be annoyed
<i>with</i> complaints” (because they will surely be
made).</p>

<p><b>another from</b>: Misused for <i>another than</i>; as, “judges
of quite <i>another</i> stamp <i>from</i> his Majesty’s judges of
Assize,” for “of quite <i>another</i> stamp <i>than</i>,” etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="another_such"></a>another such</b>: These words should be used
always in this order. Avoid “<i>such another</i> mistake,”
as incorrect; “<i>another such</i> mistake” is
better.</p>

<p><b><a id="answer"></a>answer</b>, <b>reply</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. The Standard Dictionary, quoting
Crabb says, “an <i>answer</i> is made to a question; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
<i>reply</i> is made to an assertion;” but, it continues,
“this statement is too limited, as an <i>answer</i> is made
to a charge as well as to a question.... A <i>reply</i>
is an unfolding, and implies both thought and intelligence.
<i>Reply</i> implies the formal dissection of a
statement previously made; <i>answer</i>, a ready return
of words to a question or charge that is made.”</p>

<p><b>antagonize</b>, <b>veto</b>, <b>oppose</b>, <b>forbid</b>: <i>Antagonize</i> is
distinguished from <i>veto</i> or <i>oppose</i>. In the sense of
“neutralize” or “deprive of active power” you
may <i>antagonize</i> a disease, while you <i>oppose</i> or <i>veto</i> a
bill. To <i>forbid</i> is to prohibit with authority; to <i>veto</i>
is to forbid authoritatively, with or without the right
to do so. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#alienate">ALIENATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>ante-</b>, <b>anti-</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
prefixes. <i>Ante-</i> means “before;” <i>anti-</i> means “opposite
to.” <i>Ante</i>diluvian means “before the flood”;
<i>Anti</i>christ means “opposed to Christ.”</p>

<p><b>anticipate</b>, <b>expect</b>, <b>hope</b>: As anticipate implies
“expectation with confidence and pleasure,” never
use it where mere expectation is meant, which applies
to that which we have good reason to believe
will happen. “I <i>hope</i> for a visit from my friend,
though I have no word from him; I <i>expect</i> it, when
he writes that he is coming; and as the time draws
near I <i>anticipate</i> it,” for I look forward to it with confidence
and pleasure.</p>

<p><a id="any_all_at_all"></a><b>any</b>, <b>all</b>, <b>at all</b>: Avoid using <i>any</i> adverbially in
place of the adjective. Don’t say “Did you sleep
<i>any</i>?” when you mean “Did you have <i>any</i> sleep?”
or “Did you sleep <i>at all</i>?”</p>

<p>Since <i>any</i> individualizes or separates, signifying
one or some out of a certain quantity or number,
and thus differentiating from the whole or entire
quantity or number, the word should not be used
interchangeably with <i>all</i>. “He is the finest fellow
of <i>all</i>” (not of <i>any</i> = of <i>any one fellow</i>) “I have
known.”</p>

<p><b>any</b>, <b>either</b>: <i>Any</i> is used of more than two; <i>either</i>
of two only. Do not say “the United States or
<i>either</i> of them,” say, rather, “<i>any</i> of them.”</p>

<p><b>anyhow</b>, <b>anyway</b>: “Forcible colloquial expressions
often used to indicate that something is to be
done, admitted, believed, or the like, be the circumstances,
results or conditions what they may; as
‘<i>Anyhow</i>, I have lost it;’ ‘<i>anyway</i>, I am going.’
In place of these, such expressions as ‘In any
event,’ ‘At any rate,’ ‘Be that as it may’ are ordinarily
preferred.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b><a id="any_place"></a>any place</b>, <b>some place</b>: “He won’t go <i>any place</i>;”
“I want to go <i>some place</i>.” Say, rather, “He won’t
go <i>anywhere</i>;” “I want to go <i>somewhere</i>.” These
are solecisms, unfortunately common, which should
be avoided. “Place” may be used as an indirect
object only when preceded by a preposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p><b>anyway</b>, <b>anywhere</b>: Frequently misspelled <i>anyways</i>,
<i>anywheres</i>. These words should never be
written with a final <i>s</i>.</p>

<p><b>apostasy</b>: In modern usage the last syllable is
spelled with an <i>s</i>. The alternative spelling, <i>apostacy</i>,
though occasionally used, is not preferred.</p>

<p><b><a id="apparent"></a>apparent</b>, <b>evident</b>, <b>manifest</b>: Do not confound <i>apparent</i>
with <i>evident</i>, because what is <i>apparent</i> may
or may not be <i>evident</i>. That is <i>apparent</i> which appears
to be, as <i>apparent</i> sincerity; but appearances
may be false. Things are not always what they
seem. “That is <i>evident</i> of which the mind is made
sure by some inference that supplements the fact
of perception. That is <i>manifest</i> which we can lay
the hand upon: <i>manifest</i> is thus stronger than <i>evident</i>,
as touch is more absolute than sight.” See
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#heir">HEIR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="appear"></a>appear</b>, <b>seem</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Appear</i> refers to that which manifests
itself to the senses; <i>seem</i> applies to that which is
manifest to the mind on reflection. <i>Seem</i> gives or
creates the impression of being. A man may <i>seem</i>
honest but cannot <i>appear</i> so.</p>

<p><b>appreciate</b>: This verb has the intransitive sense
of “to increase in value,” despite the fact that some
critics (though without justifiable cause) object to
its use in such a phrase as “real estate <i>appreciates</i>
as the city grows.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="apprehend"></a>apprehend</b>, <b>comprehend</b>: These terms are neither
synonymous nor interchangeable. To <i>apprehend</i> is
to perceive; to <i>comprehend</i> is to understand.</p>

<p><b>approach</b>: Sometimes incorrectly used for <i>address</i>,
<i>petition</i>, etc. One is <i>approached</i> by indirect or covert
intimation, suggestion, or question, which he may
encourage if he will, or may put aside without formal
refusal. <i>Approach</i> is often used in a bad sense,
implying the use of bribery or intrigue. Do not
say “the teachers have <i>approached</i> the Educational
Department for longer intermissions,” when you
mean “the teachers have <i>petitioned</i>,” etc.</p>

<p><b>apt</b>, <b>likely</b>: Words sometimes misapplied. <i>Apt</i>
implies natural fitness or tendency; <i>likely</i> applies to
a contingent event considered as very probable.</p>

<p><b>aren’t</b>: For <i>are not</i> when the subject follows; as,
“Aren’t you?” “Aren’t they?” The best conversational
usage contracts the verb when the subject
precedes: “we’re not,” “you’re not,” etc. Similarly
we say “I’m not,” “I’ll not.”</p>

<p><b>argue</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#augur">AUGUR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>arraign</b> <b>at</b>, <b>before</b>, <b>for</b>, <b>on</b>, <b>after</b>: “The criminal
was arraigned <i>at</i> the court” is incorrect; a criminal
is arraigned <i>at</i> the bar; <i>before</i> the court; <i>for</i> a
crime; <i>on</i> an indictment; <i>after</i> the discovery of his
crime.</p>

<p><b>articles</b>: Two or more words connected by <i>and</i>
referring to different things should each be preceded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
by the article; but when they denote the same thing,
the article is commonly used with the first only.
“<i>The</i> black-and-white horse” would denote one horse
marked with the two colors black and white. “<i>The</i>
black <i>and the</i> white horse” would denote two horses,
one black and the other white.</p>

<p><b>as ... as</b>, <b>so ... as</b>. The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>
says: A shade of difference in their meanings,
as strictly used in comparisons, is often neglected.
<i>So ... as</i> suggests that, in the comparison of the
persons or things mentioned, there is present in the
mind of the speaker a consciousness of a considerable
degree of the quality considered; <i>as ... as</i> does
not carry this impression. In “John is not <i>as</i>
tall <i>as</i> James” there is no implication that the speaker
regards either John or James as tall; there is merely
a comparison of their heights. So, too, in “John is
not <i>as</i> old <i>as</i> James” there is merely a comparison
of ages. But if one says, “John is not <i>so</i> tall <i>as</i>
James,” though the <i>so</i> is not emphasized, there is
understood usually to be a reference more or less
distinct to something uncommon in the height of
James as compared with the stature of other men or
of other boys of his age; the speaker regards James
as being <i>tall</i>. “John is not <i>so</i> old <i>as</i> James” suggests
that, in some relation or other, James is thought
of as being <i>old</i>; as in “James is taller than John.”
“Yes, but my boy is not <i>so old as</i> yours.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>In affirmative sentences <i>so</i> ... <i>as</i> can not properly
be used except in certain restricted constructions,
and where the quality referred to is to be emphasized.
It occurs oftenest in sentences that, though
affirmative in form, carry a negative suggestion; as,
“<i>So</i> good a cook <i>as</i> Polly is hard to find,” that is,
“It is not easy to find <i>so</i> good a cook <i>as</i> Polly.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Few knights of the shire [in the 17th century] had

<span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>, <i>History</i>, ch. 3.<br />
</p></div>

<p>That is, “not many knights of the shire,” etc. In
a simple affirmative comparison like “Jane is <i>as</i>
good a cook <i>as</i> Polly,” <i>so</i> ... <i>as</i> is not used.</p>

<p>In interrogative sentences, as in negative sentences,
a consciousness more or less distinct of a considerable
degree of the quality referred to is conveyed by
<i>so</i> ... <i>as</i>, but not by <i>as</i> ... <i>as</i>. “Is John <i>as</i> old
<i>as</i> James?” and “Is your uncle <i>so</i> old <i>as</i> my father?”
convey different impressions as to what the speaker
means by <i>old</i>. In the question where <i>as</i> ... <i>as</i> is
used there is no implication of considerable age in <i>old</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="as_far_as"></a>as far as</b>, <b>so far as</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. <i>As far as</i> expresses distance;
<i>so far as</i> expresses limitation, as of one’s knowledge.
Therefore, “<i>so far as</i> I know” is preferable to “<i>as
far as</i> I know.”</p>

used in comparing persons or things of approximate
caliber or size; <i>so</i> when the comparison is unequal.</p>

<p><a id="as_that"></a><b>as</b>, <b>that</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>As</i> is often improperly used for <i>that</i>. Do
not say “not <i>as</i> I know of”; “I do not know <i>as</i> I

do not know <i>that</i> I shall go.”</p>

<p><b><a id="ascent"></a>ascent</b> must be distinguished from <b>assent</b>, its homonym.
The former is derived from Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, to, +

latter is from Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, to, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sentio</i>, feel, and means
expression of concurrence in a proposition, acquiescence.</p>

Duties are not performed.</p>

<p><b><a id="astonish"></a>astonish</b>, <b>surprise</b>: Terms which some writers
claim are not synonymous or interchangeable, but
usage has made them so. To <i>astonish</i> is “to affect

with <i>astonishment</i> by some unexpected act or event.”</p>

<p>Obviously, when one says, “I am surprised,” he
uses an expression exactly equivalent to “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
struck with astonishment,” which is the equivalent
of “I am astonished.”</p>

<p><b>at</b>: Commonly but erroneously used for <i>to</i>, as an
intensive in such phrases as “Where have you been
<i>at</i>?” “Where are you going <i>at</i>?” Used also occasionally
to denote place: as, “Where does he live
<i>at</i>?” Wherever used in such connections the word
is redundant.</p>

<p><b>at all</b>: These words, supposed to have an intensive
effect, are frequently unnecessarily introduced.
“It doesn’t rain <i>at all</i>,” would be just as expressive
if written “It doesn’t rain.”</p>

<p><b>at auction</b>: In England this expression is known
as an Americanism. There, goods are put up <i>to</i>
auction and are sold <i>by</i> it&mdash;that is <i>by</i> offering them
to the highest bidder. “<i>At</i> private sale” also is
peculiar to America.</p>

<p><b>at best</b>: An erroneous form for “at <i>the</i> best.”</p>

<p><b>at</b>, <b>in</b>: Always <i>in</i> a country; either <i>at</i> or <i>in</i> a city,
town, or village; <i>at</i>, if the place is regarded as a
point; <i>in</i>, if it is inclusive; as, “We arrived <i>at</i>
Paris;” “He lives <i>in</i> London.”</p>

<p><b>at length</b>: The assumption that <i>at length</i> means
the same as <b>at last</b>, and is therefore superfluous, is
an error. Both <i>at length</i> and <i>at last</i> presuppose long
waiting; but <i>at last</i> views what comes after the waiting
as a finality; <i>at length</i> views it as intermediate
with reference to action or state that continues, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to results that are yet to follow; as, “I have invited
him often, and <i>at length</i> he is coming”; “I have
invited him often, and <i>at last</i> he has come.”</p>

<p><i>At length</i> is used also of space; as, “He wrote
me <i>at length</i>” (that is, fully or in detail). <i>At last</i> is
used of time; as, “He came back <i>at last</i>.”</p>

<p><b>at that</b>: A vulgarism of speech, sometimes defended
on the ground that the phrase is elliptical,
the omitted word or phrase being computation,
showing, or feature of the case. Avoid the usage,
however.</p>

<p><b>at you</b>: As a substitute for <i>with you</i> this is an
unpardonable vulgarism, as in the sentence “I am
angry <i>at</i> (for <i>with</i>) you.”</p>

<p><b><a id="audience"></a>audience</b>, <b>spectator</b>: An <i>audience</i> is a number of
persons assembled to listen to a play, lecture, debate,
etc.; a <i>spectator</i> is an eye-witness as of a pageant,
panorama, etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="aught"></a>aught</b>, <b>ought</b>: The former means anything whatever,
any (even the smallest) part; the latter, as a
noun, is a corruption of <i>naught</i>, a cipher. <i>Naught</i>
is of course <i>not aught</i>, that is, not anything, thus
nothing, and hence the figure 0, a cipher. Careful
speakers do not replace this word by <i>ought</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="augur"></a>augur</b>: With the sense of <i>betoken</i> or <i>portend</i>, this
word must not be confounded with <i>argue</i>. The racecourse
may <i>augur</i>, but certainly does not <i>argue</i> poverty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="authentic"></a>authentic</b>, <b>authoritative</b>, <b>genuine</b>: Often misused
as synonymous terms. That which accords with
the facts and comes from the source alleged is <i>authentic</i>;
that which has the character represented
and is true to its own claims is <i>genuine</i>; that which
possesses or emanates from proper authority and is
entitled to acceptance as such is <i>authoritative</i>.</p>

<p>Trench in “On the Study of Words” (p. 189),
says: “A <i>genuine</i> work is one written by the author
whose name it bears; an <i>authentic</i> work is one which
relates truthfully the matters of which it treats.”
And an <i>authoritative</i> work is one which contains the
results of the observations and conclusions of an author
of special ability in subjects of which he is an
acknowledged master.</p>

<p><b>auxiliary</b>: In this word the letter “<i>l</i>” is never
doubled.</p>

<p><b>avails</b>: An Americanism for <i>profits</i> or <i>proceeds</i>.</p>

<p><b>averse from</b>, <b>averse to</b>: Originally <i>averse from</i>
was commonly used to designate the turning from a
subject, as from repugnance. Present usage prefers
<i>averse to</i>, denoting aversion in the sense of hostility
toward the subject.</p>

<p><b><a id="avocation"></a>avocation</b>, <b>vocation</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. An <i>avocation</i> is that which
takes one from his regular calling. It is a minor
or irregular occupation. The term is used loosely,
sometimes by good writers, for <i>vocation</i>, which signi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>fies
the main calling or business of life. An <i>avocation</i>
is a diversion.</p>

<p><b>award</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#accord_award">ACCORD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>aware</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#conscious">CONSCIOUS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>awful</b>, <b>awfully</b>: <i>Awful</i> should not be used of things
which are merely disagreeable or annoying, nor in
the sense of excessive, exceedingly bad, great, or the
like. It is sometimes incorrectly used to designate
surprise or distress, as, an <i>awful</i> mouth, that is, a
mouth of surprising size. Do not say “He created
an <i>awful</i> scene,” when you mean that the scene he
created was <i>distressing</i>. Things cannot be “<i>awfully</i>
nice” nor persons “<i>awfully</i> jolly,” notwithstanding
the sanction of colloquial usage. Phelps relates the
following: “Two travelers at Rome once criticized
Michael Angelo’s statue of Moses. ‘Is it not <i>awful</i>?’
said one. ‘Yes,’ answered the other, ‘it is
<i>sublime</i>.’ ‘No, no!’ rejoined the other, ‘I meant
<i>awfully</i> ugly!’” That is <i>awful</i> only which inspires
awe.</p>

<p><b>aye</b>, <b>ay</b>: Meaning always, ever, and pronounced
ê (e, as in eight), is to be distinguished from <i>aye</i>,
meaning yes, and pronounced ai (ai, as in aisle).</p>




<h2>B </h2>


<p><b>back on</b>, <b>go</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#go_back_on">GO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>back</b> or <b>back up</b>, with the signification of <i>uphold</i>
or <i>support</i> has the countenance of high authority, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
is still, except in the sporting sense, regarded as
savoring of slang.</p>

<p><b>back down</b>: A colloquialism for <i>withdraw</i> as from
an argument, a position or contest.</p>

<p><b>back out</b>: A colloquialism for to <i>withdraw</i> from or
refuse to carry out an agreement.</p>

<p><b><a id="back_talk"></a>back talk</b>: A vulgarism for any impertinent reply;
as, “Don’t give me any <i>back talk</i>.” Persons of refinement
say, “Don’t be impertinent,” or, “stop your
impertinence.”</p>

<p><b><a id="bad"></a>bad</b>: This word is the antithesis of <i>good</i> and embraces
various degrees of wickedness or evil as well
as those of unsatisfactoriness. <i>Bad</i> is a term often
misapplied. One may say “a <i>bad</i> boy,” “a <i>bad</i>
egg,” but not a “<i>bad</i> accident”; say rather, “a <i>serious</i>
accident.” In referring to things which are necessarily
<i>bad</i>, or the reverse of good, select some less
pleonastic adjective. An <i>acute</i>, a <i>severe</i> or <i>gnawing</i>
pain would be preferable expressions to a <i>bad</i>
pain.</p>

<p><b><a id="bad_egg"></a>bad egg</b>: An undesirable expression used colloquially
to designate a worthless person: not used in
polite society.</p>

<p><b>bad grammar</b>: This phrase has been condemned
as false syntax by some persons unfamiliar with the
different meanings of the word <i>bad</i>. The phrase is
not only good English but is cited by the <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> as a correct example under the word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
<i>bad</i> to illustrate the meaning “containing errors or
faults; incorrect; as <i>bad grammar</i>.”</p>

<p><b>badly</b>: This word should never be used for <i>greatly</i>
or for <i>exceedingly</i>, <i>very much</i>, etc. Do not say “Your
father will miss you <i>badly</i>”; say rather, “... will
miss you greatly.” Instead of “I wanted that <i>badly</i>”
say “I wanted that <i>very much</i>” or “I was in <i>great</i>
need of that.” “The carpet needs to be beaten
<i>badly</i>” is a ludicrous blunder for “The carpet <i>badly</i>
(or very much) needs to be beaten”&mdash;the construction
connecting <i>badly</i> with <i>beating</i> rather than with
<i>needs</i> which it qualifies.</p>

<p><b><a id="balance"></a>balance</b>, <b>remainder</b>: These terms are not synonymous.
A bookkeeper obtains a <i>balance</i> as by addition
or subtraction. A mathematician deducts a smaller
sum from a greater and obtains a <i>remainder</i>. Do
not say “The <i>balance</i> of the evening was devoted to
music,” but “the <i>rest</i> of the evening....”</p>

<p><b>ball up (to)</b>, is slang for “confuse,” “embarrass”
either of which is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b>baluster</b>: Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#banister">BANISTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>band, beat the</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#beat_the_band">BEAT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="banister"></a>banister</b> is a corrupt form of <i>baluster</i> which is one of
the individual pillars which unite to form a <i>balustrade</i>.</p>

<p><b>banquet</b>: This word designating a sumptuous
feast in honor of some person or event should not
be used as the synonym of “dinner” or “supper,”
which both designate less formal functions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="bare"></a><b>bare</b> in the sense of uncover must be differentiated
from its homonym <i>bear</i>, to suffer or endure.</p>

<p><b>base</b>, <b>bass</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
terms. <i>Base</i> means the bottom or support of anything,
that part on which it rests; also, that which is
low. <i>Base</i> is sometimes used in the sense of <i>found</i>;
as, “he <i>based</i> his argument on the evidence.” In
chemistry it is a compound which unites with acid to
form a salt. <i>Bass</i> is the name of various sea-fishes;
also the name of a tree and of things made from its
fiber. In music the <i>bass</i> consists of the lowest tones
in the scale, instrumental or vocal.</p>

<p><b>bat</b>: Formerly a provincialism but now a vulgarism
for “wink.” Do not say “Quit <i>batting</i> your
eyes at me;” say rather, that is, if you must say
anything of the kind, “Stop winking at me.”</p>

<p><b><a id="bathos"></a>bathos</b> and <b>pathos</b> are sometimes separated by
only a fine line, and it may be rather a matter of intelligence
than of philology that fails to make use of
the desirable term. <i>Pathos</i> is from the Greek <i>pascho</i>,
suffer, and designates the quality that awakens the
tender emotions, as compassion or sympathy; <i>bathos</i>
is from the Greek <i>bathys</i>, deep, and signifies a ridiculous
descent from the lofty to the depths of commonplace.</p>

<p><b>battalion</b>: In this word the “t” is always doubled,
as in <i>battle</i>, from which it is derived; it is, however,
correctly spelled with only one “l.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p><b>bear</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bare">BARE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>beastly</b>: A British colloquialism expressive of disgust
or contempt; as, “This is <i>beastly</i> weather”;
sometimes even used adverbially; as, “I was <i>beastly</i>
tired.” This locution, essentially in bad taste,
though often affected by college students and others
who should know better, seems never to be defensible
except in the phrase “<i>beastly</i> drunk,” and even
this is objectionable as being a libel on the beast.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#nasty">NASTY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="beat"></a>beat</b> should not be used for “defeat.”</p>

<p><b>beat it</b> should not be used for “go away” or
“clear out.”</p>

<p><b><a id="beat_the_band"></a>beat the band</b>: A vulgarism for “to surpass or be
immeasurably superior to.”</p>

<p><b>because</b>: Although this word means “for the reason”
it is often used in the same sentence with this
expression&mdash;“The reason why I do this is <i>because</i>
(= for the reason that) I please myself by doing it.”
Substitute <i>that</i> for <i>because</i>.</p>

<p><b>because why</b>: A term common among the illiterate.
<i>Because</i> is used correctly when it precedes the
explanation of an act; <i>why</i>, when used interrogatively.
Do not say “I did it, <i>because why</i>”; here
omit “why” and continue with the reason for the
act. Instead of “I did not come sooner; <i>because
why</i>?” “I was delayed.” Say “I did not come
sooner; why? I was delayed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p><b>beef</b> is coarse slang for “boast” or “brag.”</p>

<p><b><a id="begin"></a>begin</b>: <i>Commence</i> is frequently substituted for <i>begin</i>
work where the change should not be made.
<i>Begin</i> is applied to order of time; <i>commence</i> relates
to the work on hand with reference to its subsequent
completion. The man who strikes the first blow
<i>begins</i> a fight, but both parties to a law suit <i>commence</i>
litigation at the moment when they severally undertake
the first step.</p>

<p><b>begin by him</b>: This is incorrect; say, “begin <i>with</i>
him.”</p>

<p><b>behave</b>: Strictly means “comport.” When used
with a reflexive pronoun as, “Behave <i>yourself</i>,” this
word is correctly applied. When the pronoun is
omitted as, “Will you <i>behave</i>?” the sentence is incomplete
and the expression a mere colloquialism.</p>

<p><b>being</b>: The phrases “is <i>being</i> built,” “was <i>being</i>
built,” and kindred forms of English imperfects
passive are condemned by certain critics as recent
and unwarranted; Fitzedward Hall points out that
they are neither recent nor unwarranted, and have
been used by the best writers for a century. He
says: “Prior to the evolution of <i>is being built</i> and <i>was
being built</i>, we possessed no discriminate equivalents
of <i>ædificatur</i> and <i>ædificabatur</i>; <i>is built</i> and <i>was built</i>,
by which they were rendered, corresponding exactly
to <i>ædificatus est</i> and <i>ædificatus erat</i>.”&mdash;<i>Modern English</i>,
App., p. 350.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Is growing</i>, <i>was growing</i>, indicate an activity from
within; as, the tree <i>is growing</i> (from its own internal
forces); <i>is being grown</i>, <i>was being grown</i>, the activity
of some agent from without; as, the plant <i>is being
grown</i> (by the gardener). So also, and strikingly, <i>is
bleeding</i> (as from a wound), and <i>is being bled</i> (as by a
surgeon).</p>

<p><b>belong</b>: Used absolutely; as, “He doesn’t <i>belong</i>,”
“We all <i>belong</i>” (<i>sc.</i>, to this organization,
society, community, or in the place, sphere, or associations
where actually present): recent in the
United States, and apparently rapidly spreading in
popular use, though with no literary support.</p>

<p><b>beneficence</b>, <b>benevolence</b>: Although formerly the
meanings of these words were distinct they are not
so any longer, and <i>benevolence</i> now includes <i>beneficence</i>.
“<i>Beneficence</i>, the quality of being beneficent or charitable:
<i>benevolence</i> is the disposition to seek the well-being
or comfort of others; charitableness.” According
to the etymology and original usage <i>beneficence</i>
is the doing well, <i>benevolence</i>, the wishing or
willing well to others; but <i>benevolence</i> has come to
include <i>beneficence</i> and to displace it. We should not
now speak of <i>benevolence</i> which did not help.</p>

<p><b>benefit</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#advantage">ADVANTAGE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="bequest"></a>bequest</b>, <b>devise</b>, <b>legacy</b>: These words are not exactly
synonymous. A <i>bequest</i> is a leaving by will of
personal property of any kind; a <i>devise</i> is a gift of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
land by a last will and testament; a <i>legacy</i> is personal
property bequeathed. <i>Devise</i> is sometimes used
loosely for any testamentary disposition of property
but, applied strictly, refers specifically to land, whereas
<i>legacy</i> applies to any kind of personal property.</p>

<p><b>berth</b>, <b>birth</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>Berth</i>, which is probably derived from <i>bear</i>,
(Anglo-Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">beran</i>, carry), means a place of accommodation,
whether as bunk or bed, apartment, or engagement.
<i>Birth</i>, similarly pronounced and derived,
means “a coming into existence.”</p>

<p><b>beside</b>, <b>besides</b>: Much confusion exists, and has
long existed regarding these words. Gould, who in
his work on “Good English” explained the use of
these terms in 1856, from which Webster borrowed
in 1876, states that “besides is always a preposition
and only a preposition.” This is not so. It is
sometimes an adverb when used in its prepositional
sense of “by the side (of).”</p>

<p>Of <i>besides</i> as a preposition, Skeat, in his “Etymological
Dictionary,” says:&mdash;“The more correct
form is <i>beside</i>; ‘besides’ is a later development,
due to the habit of using the suffix -es to form adverbs;
the use of <i>besides</i> as a preposition, is, strictly
incorrect, but is as old as the 12th century.”</p>

<p><i>Beside</i> is also a preposition in the sense of “in comparison
with” and “physically or mentally remote
from.” “<i>Beside</i> your work his is poor”; “<i>Beside</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the point at issue”; “The poor fellow is <i>beside</i> himself.”
<i>Besides</i> as a preposition means “in addition
to” or “except.” “<i>Besides</i> wealth he had health”;
“<i>Besides</i> death he knew no fear.” As an adverb it
means “moreover” or “other than.” “<i>Besides</i>, it
is late”; “He was heedless of all the world <i>besides</i>.”
<i>Beside</i>, then, conveys the idea of conjunction, separation
or comparison; whereas <i>besides</i> implies addition
or exception.</p>

<p><b>between</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#among_between">AMONG</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>between you and I</b>: This is incorrect. Both
pronouns are objects of the preposition <i>between</i> and
should be in the objective case; say “<i>between you
and me</i>.” Compare <span class="smcap"><a href="#you_and_I">you and I</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>bevy</b>: A word sometimes misapplied. It is applied
correctly to a company of girls, a flock of birds,
as, quail, grouse, or larks; also to a small herd of
deer or heifers.</p>

<p><b><a id="big"></a>big</b>, <b>great</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>Big</i> is not synonymous with <i>great</i>. A man
may be physically <i>big</i> but is not necessarily <i>great</i>
mentally. Emerson was mentally a <i>great</i> man, and
although tall physically he was not a <i>big</i> man. <i>Big</i>
and <i>large</i> are synonymous, but while <i>big</i> is more emphatic,
<i>large</i> is a more refined or elegant term.</p>

<p><b><a id="big-bug"></a>big-bug</b>: A slang term used to denote a person of
consequence, actual or self-imagined. Say rather,
“A prominent” or, “an important man.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p><b>big-wig</b>: A slang term common in England for a
person in authority or of prominence. Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#big-bug">BIG-BUG</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>bird</b>: In the phrase “You’re a bird” an inane
and, therefore, undesirable expression.</p>

<p><b>bit</b>: Primarily a <i>bite</i>, a small <i>piece</i>, or by extension
a small quantity; as, a <i>bit</i> of bread, a <i>bit</i> of fun. By
error, the word is sometimes applied to liquids; as,
“there is not a <i>bit</i> of water on the farm.” But when
reference is to liquid to be drunk, it is more discriminating
to say, not a <i>bit</i>, but a <i>sip</i>.</p>

<p><b>blame on</b>: Indefensible slang. We blame a person
<i>for</i> a fault, or lay the blame <i>upon</i> him. Not,
as in a New York newspaper, after the last Presidential
election, “I do not <i>blame</i> the defeat <i>on</i> the
President,” but “I do not <i>blame</i> the President <i>for</i>
the defeat,” or “I do not <i>lay the blame ... upon</i>,”
etc.</p>

<p><b>blow</b>: A colloquialism for boastful talk, which is
expressed less coarsely but with as much force by
“bluster” or “brag.”</p>

<p><b>blowhard</b>: A coarse term for “boaster” synonymous
with windbag; not used by persons of refinement.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#windbag">WINDBAG</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>boiled shirt</b>: A slang phrase designating a white
linen shirt. It originated in the Western States of
America but its use is widespread among persons
addicted to careless diction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p><b>boost, to</b>: A vulgarism for “to assist”; used also
as a noun, as “He gave me a <i>boost</i> in business” for
“He assisted me....”</p>

<p><b>borne</b>, the past participle of <i>bear</i>, must not be confounded
with the adjective <b>born</b>. “Man is <i>born</i> to
sorrow, which may or may not be well <i>borne</i>.”</p>

<p><b>both</b>: When <i>both</i> is used in a negative sentence, the
meaning intended is sometimes doubtful. “<i>Both</i> applicants
were not accepted.” Were both applicants
rejected? Or, was one rejected and the other accepted?
Or, was neither applicant accepted or rejected?
A similar confusion of sense occurs in some
negative sentences containing <i>all</i>, when <i>not</i> is misplaced;
this practically contradicts the sense intended,
or makes it ambiguous; as, <i>all</i> will not go,
that is, <i>not all</i> will go&mdash;meaning some will and some
will not go. “<i>All</i> were not of that mind” (probably)
<i>not all</i> were of that mind, or (possibly) <i>all</i> were
of a different mind or minds from the one spoken
of. So, also, when all is used substantively. “<i>All</i>
that glisters is not gold”&mdash;<i>not all</i> that glisters is
gold. A peculiarity of <i>both</i> is that it can not be negatived
by connecting <i>not</i> immediately with it, except
elliptically in sentences of unusual form that are
obviously arranged for the prevention of misunderstanding&mdash;as
in correcting the doubtful meaning of
the sentence cited above, “<i>Both</i> applicants were not
accepted.” If one asks, in order to clear its confu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>sing
impression, “Were <i>both</i> rejected?” the reply may
properly be, “<i>Not both</i> were rejected; one was rejected
and one accepted”&mdash;a connection of <i>not</i> with
<i>both</i> that is usually inadmissible. The confusion in
meaning of a negative sentence containing <i>both</i> will
be best avoided by making the sentence affirmative;
“<i>Both</i> applicants were rejected,” “One of the two
applicants was rejected and the other accepted,”
etc.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>both</b>: As an adjective or pronoun <i>both</i> emphasizes
the idea of <i>two</i>. It has been well defined as “the
two, and not merely one of them”; it can not properly,
therefore, be connected with or refer to more
than two objects. As a conjunction, however, <i>both</i>
has a more extended meaning and employment than
it has as an adjective or a pronoun; thus, it is permissible
to say, “He lost all his live stock&mdash;<i>both</i>
horses, cows, and sheep.” <i>Both</i>, as so used, emphasizes
the extent or comprehensiveness of the assertion.
The use has been challenged, but has
abundant literary authority, and antedates Chaucer.</p>

<p><b>both alike</b>: A pleonasm. Two things may be <i>alike</i>
but <i>alike</i> should not be used as an adjective. <i>Both</i>
daughters may be <i>like</i> their mother, but to say they
are <i>both alike</i>, meaning that they resemble each other,
is incorrect. <i>Both</i> should never be used with <i>alike</i>.</p>

<p><b>bounce</b>: A colloquialism for “discharge” or “eject
forcibly,” an apt rather than an elegant term.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p><b>bound</b>: This word may be the participial adjective
of <i>buā</i>, prepare, or the past participle of <i>bindan</i>, bind.
The words should not be confused. “I am <i>bound</i>
to have it:” yes, if constrained or compelled; but
no, if merely resolved. It is true that in the United
States a colloquial usage to this effect has become
popular, but it is none the less an error of speech.</p>

<p><b><a id="bountiful"></a>bountiful</b>, <b>plentiful</b>: <i>Bountiful</i> which originally
meant “generous in bestowing gifts” has gradually
come to mean “showing abundance,” “yielding in
plenty.” In the latter sense it is synonymous with
<i>plentiful</i>.</p>

<p><b>bourne</b>: From the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">borne</i>, bourne (Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bodina</i>, limit), means that which marks the end, and
hence the end or goal. It does not mean <i>country</i>
which it is so often supposed to mean&mdash;presumedly
from Hamlet’s “undiscovered country, from whose
<i>bourne</i> no traveller returns.” Readers who on this
authority construe <i>bourne</i> as country make the mistake
of substituting the word “which” for the phrase
“whose” bourne.</p>

<p><b>brand-new</b> often incorrectly written <i>bran-new</i>.
The original and etymologically correct form of this
word is <i>brand-new</i>, from <i>brand</i>, meaning “fire” or
“burning,” and <i>new</i> meaning “fresh”&mdash;the “fire-new”
of Shakespeare (Twelfth Night, act. iii., sc. 2)
is best explained by his own words, “fire-new from
the mint,” meaning “fresh and bright” like a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
coin, as being newly come from the fire and forge.
<i>Bran-new</i> is a colloquialism.</p>

<p><b>brand of Cain</b>: By a peculiar perversion of facts,
this is invariably referred to as a stigma similar to
the scarlet letter with which Hester Prynne was indeed
branded. But the brand was an act of mercy
and “a token of Divine protection,” for “the Lord
set a mark on Cain, lest any finding him should slay
him.”</p>

<p><b><a id="bravery"></a>bravery</b>, <b>courage</b>: Inasmuch as the courageous
may be without <i>bravery</i> and the brave without <i>courage</i>
a careful discrimination should always be made
in the use of these terms. <i>Courage</i> is rather a virtue
of the mind, whereas <i>bravery</i> is temperamental.
Your <i>courage</i> may ooze out, as it were, at the palms
of your hands, but bravery which is instinctive, remains.
For this reason bravery may often be misplaced,
true <i>courage</i>&mdash;which ever seeks to do the right
thing at the right time, regardless of results&mdash;never.</p>

<p><b>bred and born</b>: An erroneous sequence of words.
One is <i>born</i> before one is <i>bred</i>; therefore say “<i>born
and bred</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="brevity"></a>brevity</b>, <b>conciseness</b>: Words sometimes misused.
<i>Brevity</i> is commonly applied to shortness of time,
but it has the sanction of literary usage for <i>conciseness</i>
or condensation of language into few words. A
speech may be <i>concise</i> yet comprehensive; that is, it
may cover the entire range of a subject in few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
words and as such be characterized by <i>conciseness</i>;
another may be short in duration, the theme being
one that does not permit of expansion and as such
be characterized by <i>brevity</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="bring"></a>bring</b>, <b>carry</b>, <b>fetch</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Bring</i> expresses motion toward
some person, place, or thing, and implies to bear
from a distant place to one nearer; <i>carry</i> expresses
motion away from; <i>fetch</i> expresses motion from a
given place to another, as for the purpose of obtaining
some article, and return to the given place
with the article required. <i>Go and fetch</i> is pleonastic.</p>

<p><b>Britannia</b>: This word is often misspelled “Brittannia.”
It is from Britain and should be spelled with
only one “t” but two “n’s.”</p>

<p><b>broach</b>, <b>brooch</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. Although both are derived from the
same source etymologically (Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">broca</i>, a spike)
they are now widely different in meaning. A <i>broach</i>
may mean “a boring into an opening, a spit, or a
spire.” It is also the name of the boring bits or drills
used in carpentering or engineering. It means also
“to approach any one in conversation” on some particular
subject. A <i>brooch</i> is “a breastpin or an ornamental
pin or clasp used as for display or to fasten
some part of a dress.”</p>

<p><b><a id="broke"></a>broke</b>: A word often misused for “broken.” Do
not say “I’m <i>broke</i>” say rather “broken”&mdash;<b>To go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
broke</b>: A colloquial phrase common in commercial
circles for “to become bankrupt.” These terms
are avoided by persons who cultivate a refined
diction.</p>

<p><b>brothers</b>: Distinguished from <b>brethren</b>. The one
applies to those who are <i>brothers</i> by birth, whereas
the other indicates fraternal relationship in some
order or society.</p>

<p><b>building</b>, <b>being built</b>: There are advocates of
either form. Fitzedward Hall has shown conclusively
that “is being built” has been used by the
best writers for a century or more, and now has universal
literary sanction. Richard Whately, George
P. Marsh, Richard Grant White, and other critics
have strenuously objected to this use. In literature
there is support enough for their views: Milton
wrote “while the Temple of the Lord <i>was building</i>.”
Dr. Johnson, in writing to Boswell, of his <i>Lives of
the Poets</i> said “My ‘Lives’ <i>are reprinting</i>;” Macaulay
followed the same style and wrote “Chelsea
Hospital <i>was building</i>”; “while innocent blood <i>was</i>
shedding.” <i>Being</i> has a special modern use with
passive forms of verbs to express progressive action.
For example, is, are, or <i>was being</i> built, expresses
what is expressed also by is, are, or <i>was building</i>,
<i>a-building</i>, or <i>in building</i>. Both forms are permissible,
but “is <i>being built</i>” is more frequently heard
and, perhaps, preferable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="building_construction"></a><b>building</b>, <b>construction</b>: Alfred Ayres (<i>Some Ill-used
Words</i>, p. 44) quotes the following example
of the misuse of these words: “These two advisory
bodies have recommended the <i>building</i> of battleships.
It is understood that Mr. Long is opposed to the
<i>construction</i> [constructing] of any armorclads.” Mr.
Ayres points out that if <i>building</i> is correct&mdash;and it
is&mdash;then <i>construction</i> is incorrect and the correct word
to use is <i>constructing</i>.</p>

<p><b>bum</b>: A vulgar term for “an idle, dissolute fellow;
a loafer,”&mdash;<b>on the bum</b>. A vulgar phrase used to denote
that that to which it is applied is of poor quality,
badly done, or has been subjected to careless
treatment.</p>

<p><b>busted</b>: A slang term for financially broken, not
used by persons accustomed to a refined diction.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#broke">BROKE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>but</b>, <b>however</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. Do not say “He is suffering&mdash;not,
<i>however</i>, acutely;” say rather, “He is suffering,
<i>but</i> not acutely.”</p>

<p><b><a id="but_that"></a>but that</b>: Implies a negative, but when it follows
another negative phrase (as “I <i>don’t know but that</i> I
did it”) it suggests the positive or, as in the example
given above, the likelihood or possibility that some
act has been done. Locutions of this kind should
be avoided as inelegant, say rather “I may have
done it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p><b>but what</b>: This is equivalent to <i>but that which</i> and
is an incorrect expression for <i>but that</i>. “I am not
sure <i>but what</i> I shall be there” should be written <i>but
that</i>, and indicates the possibility or even probability
of being there; but note that if the <i>but</i> be omitted
from the latter (and correct) usage, the indication is
the reverse. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#but_that">BUT THAT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>but yet</b>: Should not be used when either <i>but</i> or <i>yet</i>
is sufficient by itself; as, “Wealth may seek us; <i>but</i>
wisdom must be sought”; not <i>but yet</i>. When, however,
Archbishop Trench says, “<i>But yet</i> these pains
hand us over to true pleasures” (<i>Study of Words</i>,
p. 232), each conjunction has its distinct adversative
sense. This appears still more clearly in “Ye are
but common men, <i>but</i> [on the contrary] <i>yet</i> [notwithstanding
that fact] ye think with minds not common.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Coleridge</span>
<i>Wallenstein</i> 2, 3.</p>

<p><b>bute</b>: A vulgar corruption of “beauty” used by
illiterates; as, “She’s a <i>bute</i>.” Correctly “She is a
beauty” or “a beautiful woman.”</p>

<p><b>butt in, to</b>: A vulgar although expressive phrase
meaning “to interfere officiously or inquisitively
with,” not used by persons accustomed to refined
diction.</p>

<p><b><a id="by"></a>by</b>: Properly used before the agent or doer; <i>with</i>
before the instrument or means; as, “He was killed
<i>by</i> the assassin <i>with</i> a dagger.” But active forces
are often thought of as agents, so that we properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
say “The house was destroyed <i>by</i> fire.” “His
friends were displeased <i>by</i> the selection of another
chairman” means that the action displeased them;
“his friends were displeased <i>with</i> the selection,” etc.,
means that the man selected was not their choice.</p>

<p>“A gentleman <i>by</i> the name of Hinkley.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! You mean ‘A gentleman <i>of</i> the name of
Hinkley.’ This is English, you know.”</p>

<p>One may say “I know no one <i>of</i> the name of
Brown,” or “I know no one <i>by</i> the name of Brown”;
but the meaning is different. One might know a
man <i>of</i> the name of Brown, but know him <i>by</i> the
name of Smith. It is better to say simply “a man
named Brown.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>




<h2>C </h2>


<p><b>cabbage</b> for “steal” or “crib,” as from a pony,
is schoolboy slang.</p>

<p><b><a id="cake_takes_the"></a>cake, takes the</b>: A slang equivalent for “wins
the prize.” Used usually to designate that the person,
act, or statement to which it is applied exceeds
in impudence anything within the knowledge of the
persons present.</p>

<p><b>calculate</b>: The verb signifies to ascertain by mathematical
or scientific computation; and the word
<i>calculated</i> therefore strictly means adapted by calculation.
It is then illogical to speak of “measures
<i>calculated</i> to do harm” when the measures were in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fact designated for a specific purpose&mdash;that of doing
good.</p>

<p><b>calligraphy</b> and <b>cacography</b> respectively mean good
and bad writing. It is therefore pleonastic to speak
of excellent <i>calligraphy</i> or wretched <i>cacography</i>; and
to describe the former as wretched would simply
be to say that at the same time it was both excellent
and the reverse.</p>

<p><b>cameo</b>: The plural of the word is not formed by
adding “<span class="lock">-es</span>” as in “potato” or “grotto” but by
the adding of “<span class="lock">-s</span>”; as, <i>cameos</i>.</p>

<p><b>can</b>: Misused for <i>may</i>. <i>Can</i> always refers to some
form of possibility. An armed guard may say “You
<i>can</i> not pass,” since he has physical power to prevent;
hence the question “<i>Can</i> I pass the guard?”
is perfectly natural. But where simple permission
is required <i>may</i> should be used. “<i>May</i> I (not
<i>can</i> I) use your ruler?”</p>

<p><b>can but</b>, <b>can not but</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these phrases. Both these sentences are
grammatically correct, though they have not exactly
the same meaning: “I <i>can not but</i> believe your
proposition” means “I <i>can not help</i> believing,” etc.;
while “I <i>can but</i> believe your proposition” means
“I <i>can only</i> believe,” etc., a much less strong assertion.</p>

<p><b>canine</b> should not be used for “dog.”</p>

<p><b>cannon</b>, a tubular gun, comes from Greek <i>kanna</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
reed, and must be distinguished from <b>canon</b>, a rule
or law, which comes from the Greek <i>kanon</i>, rule.</p>

<p><b>capacity</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#ability">ABILITY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>caption</b> is not to be used in the sense of title, save
as to a legal document “showing the time, place,
circumstances and authority&mdash;under which it was
made or executed.” “The affectation of fine big-sounding
words which have a flavor of classical
learning has had few more laughable or absurd
manifestations than the use of <i>caption</i> (which means
seizure, act of taking) in the sense ... of heading.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">R.
G. White</span>, <i>Words and Their Uses</i>, ch. 5, p. 98.</p>

<p><b>carnival</b>, which comes from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caro</i>, flesh, +
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">levo</i>, take away, and alludes in Catholic countries to
the pre-Lenten “farewell to meat,” which concludes
with Mardi Gras, has been stigmatized by Dr. William
Mathews as an “outlandish term” which “has
not a shadow of justification” in the popular sense
of a gay festivity or revel. Inasmuch as the pre-Lenten
farewell is marked by festival, frolic and
fun, the stigmatization is undeserved, and such expressions
as “the crows are holding high <i>carnival</i>
on the hill” are not merely permissible but good.</p>

<p><b>carry</b>: Although formerly used with the meaning
of “conduct,” “guide,” or “escort” the term in
this sense is now archaic. Do not say “Mr. A.
<i>carried</i> Miss B. to the party;” say rather, “...
<i>escorted</i> Miss B....” Compare also <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bring">BRING</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p><b>case</b>: Not to be applied to persons. The expression
sometimes used of an eccentric or vicious
person, “He is a <i>case</i>” or “a hard <i>case</i>,” is an objectionable
colloquialism.</p>

<p><b><a id="casket"></a>casket</b>, which is from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">casque</i>, helmet, is
frequently now used in the United States as a euphemism
for <b>coffin</b>, which is from the Greek <i>kophinos</i>,
basket. Such innovations are not to be recommended.
They savor of pedantry, or, worse still,
of pride. If <i>coffin</i> is not good enough for the worthy
deceased or for his purse-proud relatives, why rest
content with the simple <i>casket</i>, when by a mere figure
of speech <b>sarcophagus</b> may save the reputation of
both the living and the dead?</p>

<p><b>casuality</b> is an obsolete form of <b>casualty</b>, and
should be treated as such.</p>

<p><b>cataclasm</b> and <b>cataclysm</b> are often interchanged.
The Greek <i>kata</i>, down, is combined in the one case
with <i>klaō</i>, break, and in the other with <i>klyzo</i>, wash.
Where sudden overwhelming change is intended, as
by revolution, <i>cataclasm</i> is to be preferred to <i>cataclysm</i>,
which, though sometimes used to signify such
a change, is strictly applied to an overwhelming
flood of water, and, specifically, to the Noachian
deluge.</p>

<p><b>catch on</b>, <b>to</b>: A colloquialism having two distinct
meanings, the first bordering on the vulgar, is used
by persons with little sense of refinement in speech<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
for “to understand”; the second, used instead of
“to suit the popular fancy” or “to please the
popular taste.”</p>

<p><b><a id="ceiling"></a>ceiling</b> which in derivation is allied with the French
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ciel</i>, Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cœlum</i>, heaven, is to be distinguished from its
homonym <b>sealing</b>, the act of attesting with a seal,
which springs etymologically from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sigillum</i>,
dim. of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum</i>, mark.</p>

<p><b>celery</b>, <b>salary</b>: Exercise care in spelling these
words. <i>Celery</i> is a biennial herb; <i>salary</i>, a periodical
allowance made as compensation for services.</p>

<p><b><a id="cereal"></a>cereal</b>, a word derived from <i>Ceres</i>, the goddess of
corn. It has nothing in common, save the sound,
with <i>serial</i>, which fitly describes a literary publication
in parts issued successively (Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">series</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sere</i>
join). Exercise care in spelling these words.</p>

<p><b><a id="cession"></a>cession</b>, from Latin of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cedo</i>, yield, meaning surrender,
must not be confounded with <i>session</i>, from
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedeo</i>, sit, as used in the expression a <i>session</i> of
court.</p>

<p><b><a id="character"></a>character</b>, <b>reputation</b>: These are not synonymous
terms. <i>Character</i> is what one is; <i>reputation</i> is that
which one is thought to be. <i>Character</i> includes both
natural and acquired traits; <i>reputation</i> designates
only those traits acquired as by contact with one’s
fellow men. Holland in <i>Gold Foil</i> (p. 219) makes
the following distinction: “<i>Character</i> lives in a man;
<i>reputation</i> outside of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p><b>chargeable</b>: Do not spell this word <i>chargable</i>.
Remember its components are <i>charge</i> + <i>able</i> and the
“e” is retained before the second “a.”</p>

<p><b>cherubim</b> and <b>seraphim</b>: Do not use these plurals
as singulars. There is no such thing as <i>a cherubim</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="chew_the_rag"></a>chew the rag</b>: A low phrase sometimes used as
an equivalent for “wrangle;” as, “stop chewing the
rag,” meaning, “cease wrangling.” The use of expressions
of this kind can not be too severely condemned.</p>

<p><b>childlike</b>, <b>childish</b>: There is a distinction between
these words. The one is used in a good sense, the
other is spoken in derogation.</p>

<p><b><a id="chin_music"></a>chin music</b>: A low phrase sometimes used as an
equivalent for “talk,” but not uttered by persons of
refinement.</p>

<p><b>chuck-full</b> is the American colloquial form of <i>choke-</i>
or <i>chock-full</i>, but this form finds no literary favor, and
indeed the expression is far from elegant, both in
sense and sound.</p>

<p><b>circus</b>: This word should not be used as a
synonym of “frolic;” as such it is a vulgar perversion.</p>

<p><b><a id="cite"></a>cite</b>, from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">citer</i> (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cito</i>, frequentative
of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cieo</i>, call), means “mention by name, summon”
and has no relationship with <i>site</i>, similarly
pronounced, which means “local position,” and is
derived from Lat. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">situa</i>, pp. of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sino</i>, put.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p><b>citizen</b>: Not to be used for <i>person</i>, except when
civic relations are referred to. “All <i>citizens</i> are entitled
to the protection of the law,” but not “Ten
<i>citizens</i> were walking up the street,” unless reference
is had to some civic relation, as when opposed to
soldiers, policemen, residents of the country, or the
like.</p>

<p><b>claim</b>: “He <i>claimed</i> that the discovery was his,”
“I <i>claim</i> that this is true,” etc. Incorrect if the
meaning is simply <i>assert</i> or <i>maintain</i>; but correct if
the meaning is <i>assert</i> with readiness to <i>maintain</i>, and
confidence that the thing <i>asserted</i> can be <i>maintained</i>,
with the added idea that it makes for the advantage
or side of him who <i>asserts</i> and <i>maintains</i> it.</p>

<p><b>clever</b>: In American colloquial usage <i>clever</i> means
“<i>good-natured and obliging</i>”; in English use it
means “skilful.” The American synonym for the
English meaning of “clever” is <i>smart</i>, and the English
synonym for the American meaning of “clever”
is <i>jolly</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="climax"></a>climax</b>, <b>acme</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A <i>climax</i> is a successive increase in
force of language for the purpose of intensifying it.
The <i>acme</i> is the highest point or greatest intensity
attained.</p>

<p><b>climb down</b>: As <i>to climb</i> signifies ascension, this
colloquialism of the United States is apparently unwarranted.
If, however, a descent be laborious, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
though by hands and feet, <i>crawl</i> should be used as
a substitute for <i>climb</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="coeval"></a>coeval</b>, <b>contemporary</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. <i>Coeval</i> is said of things existing
at the same time; <i>contemporary</i> is applied to persons
living in the same period.</p>

<p><b>coffin</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#casket">CASKET</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>common</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#mutual">MUTUAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="commonly"></a>commonly</b>: Do not confound this word with <i>generally</i>,
<i>frequently</i>, <i>usually</i>. That is <i>commonly</i> done
which is common to all; that is <i>generally</i> done, which
is done by the larger number; that is <i>frequently</i> done
which is done by a large number or by a single
person on many occasions; that is <i>usually</i> done
which is customarily done whether by many or one.</p>

<p><b>community</b> is not a common noun personified,
and therefore should always be preceded by the
article. Congress and Parliament, State and Church
have been personified, and may accordingly be used
definitely in the singular number without the article;
but to permit such treatment to army, navy, public,
or <i>community</i> would be a literary solecism.</p>

<p><b>compare to</b> or <b>with</b>: We compare one thing <i>with</i>
another to note points of agreement or difference.
We <i>compare</i> one thing <i>to</i> another which we believe
it resembles.</p>

<p>“As a writer of English he [Addison] is not to be
<i>compared</i> except with great peril to his reputation,
<i>to</i> at least a score of men.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Richard Grant White</span>,
<i>Words and their Uses</i>, ch. 4, p. 79.</p>

<p>He should have said <i>with</i>. If Addison is to be
<i>compared to</i> the (presumably) able writers referred
to, it can not be with “peril to his reputation.” If
<i>comparing</i> him <i>with</i> these men is perilous to his reputation,
then for his sake the comparison should
not be made. The sentence is an attempt to combine
two ideas incompatible in a single construction,
<i>viz.</i>, “If he is <i>compared with</i> these men, it will be to
his disadvantage,” and “He is not to be <i>compared
to</i> these men.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>complected</b> for <b>complexioned</b> is dialectical in the
United States, and not sanctioned in general usage.</p>

<p><b>complement</b>, <b>compliment</b>: Discriminate carefully
between these words. <i>Complement</i> means “full quantity
or number; that which is needed to complete
or fill up some quantity or thing; or a complete or
symmetrical whole.” A <i>compliment</i> is “a delicate
flattery, an expression of admiration or an act of
civility or courtesy.”</p>

<p><b><a id="complete"></a>complete</b>: A speech may be <i>finished</i> but far from
<i>complete</i>. To <i>finish</i> is to bring to an end, but to <i>complete</i>
is to bring to a state in which there is nothing
more to do. You <i>finish</i> your dinner, but <i>complete</i>
your toilet.</p>

<p><b>conclude</b> should not be used for “close.” To <i>conclude</i>
is a mental process; to <i>close</i> a physical one.</p>

<p><b>condign</b> means “well-merited”; therefore, the
common phrase “<i>condign</i> punishment” is correct,
but the phrase “Deserving (or not deserving)
<i>condign</i> punishment,” is absurd because tautological.</p>

<p><b>conduct</b>: Although the dictionaries give both a
transitive and intransitive place to this verb in the
signification of “behave,” it should properly be used
only reflexively, as a transitive. Say, “How did the
débutante <i>conduct</i> herself?” rather than “How
did the débutante <i>conduct</i>?”</p>

<p><b>congregation</b>, <b>corps</b>: Exercise care in the use of
these words. A <i>congregation</i> is an assemblage of
persons who meet as for religious worship or instruction;
a <i>corps</i> is a body of men associated in
some specific work, as a marine <i>corps</i>; a <i>corps</i> of engineers.
A <i>congregation</i> embraces both sexes, <i>corps</i>
is restricted to the male sex.</p>

<p><b>con man</b>: A vulgar term for a swindler’s decoy
or “bunco-steerer”; a <i>confidence man</i>: not used in
polite society.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="conscious"></a>conscious</b>, which relates to knowledge within one’s
self, should not be used for <i>aware</i>, which implies
being on the lookout. The one refers only to the
past, or a present allied to the past, the other to the
future. We are <i>conscious</i> of suffering, but <i>aware</i> of
imminent danger. One is <i>conscious</i> of the inner
workings of his own mind, but <i>aware</i> of that which
exists without him.</p>

<p><b><a id="constantly"></a>constantly</b> does not always mean “continually.”
A man eats <i>constantly</i> but he would soon cease to be
a man if he were to eat <i>continuously</i>. In this sense
<i>constantly</i> means “regularly” and <i>continuously</i>
means “without ceasing.” <i>Perpetually</i>, which means
“incessantly,” must also, and for the same reason,
be distinguished from <i>constantly</i>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#perpetually">PERPETUALLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="construct"></a>construct</b>: Although this verb formerly had the
meaning of <i>construe</i>, both words having the same
etymology, being derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">con</i>, together,
+ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">strua</i>, pile up, it must no longer be used
as synonymous therewith. You <i>construe</i> a sentence

to reside in a foreign port or city as the representative
of his country’s commercial interests; a <i>counsel</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
is a lawyer engaged to give advice or act as advocate
in court; a <i>council</i> is a body of persons elected or
appointed to assist in the administration of government
or to legislate; a <i>councilor</i> is a member of a
council; a <i>counselor</i> is one who gives counsel; or,
who is an adviser or a lawyer.</p>

<p><b>contagious</b>, <b>contiguous</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A disease may be <i>contagious</i>,
that is catching; fear is <i>contagious</i> when it spreads
from one to another. <i>Contiguous</i> is used chiefly of
neighboring regions or places and means “adjacent
or situated so as to touch.”</p>

<p><b><a id="contemplate"></a>contemplate</b>: May be used in the sense of <i>plan</i>,
<i>intend</i>, but unless the matter in question be somewhat
doubtful and involves further thoughtful consideration,
it is better to say <i>intend</i> or <i>propose</i>.</p>

<p><b>contemptible</b>, <b>contemptibly</b>, <b>contemptuous</b>, <b>contemptuously</b>:
Discriminate carefully between these
words. A <i>contemptible</i> person is one deserving of
contempt as for meanness or vileness; <i>contemptibly</i>
means “in a contemptible manner” or “in a manner
deserving of contempt.” A <i>contemptuous</i> person is
“a disdainful person.” One who speaks <i>contemptuously</i>
of another speaks of him with scorn or disdain.</p>

<p><b>continual</b>, <b>continuous</b>: <i>Continual</i> implies the repeated
renewal of an act; <i>continuous</i> means its
unceasing continuity. The following sentence will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
serve to illustrate the correct use of these words;
“<i>Continual</i> interruptions impede <i>continuous</i> work.”</p>

<p><b>continually</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#constantly">CONSTANTLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>controller</b>, derived from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contre rôle</i> and
indicating a person whose office it is to keep a
counter roll or check in the accounts of others,
should not properly be spelt <i>comptroller</i>, which
word originates in a false derivation from <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">compter</i>,
to count. Instead of the word being thus derived,
the spelling has been accommodated by some to the
imagined derivation.</p>

<p><b><a id="convenient"></a>convenient</b>, <b>commodious</b>: These terms are not
always interchangeable. A room may be “convenient”
in that it is suitable for a required purpose
and “commodious” because it affords ample accommodation
for the purpose for which it is applied. A
book may be <i>convenient</i> in size or arrangement but
not <i>commodious</i>.</p>

<p><b>correspond</b>. When the word means “answer or
conform to” it is followed by the preposition <i>to</i>;
when it means “hold written communication” the
preposition is <i>with</i>.</p>

<p><b>cotemporary</b> which implies “equally temporary”
should not be used for “contemporary” which means
existing at the same time.</p>

<p><b>cough up</b>: Used as an equivalent for “pay up,”
is vulgar and, therefore, not used in polite society.</p>

<p><b>council</b>, <b>councilor</b>, <b>counsel</b>, <b>etc.</b> Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#consul">CONSUL</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="couple"></a>couple</b>: Does not mean merely two, but two united,
as it were by links. Thus a man and wife illustrate a
<i>couple</i>; but to talk of “a couple of weeks” is an absurdity
for were two weeks coupled so as to become
one, the product (one week multiplied by two) would
no longer be a week but a fortnight.</p>

<p><a id="couple_two"></a><b>couple</b>, <b>two</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
terms. <i>Couple</i> as an indefinite amount is a Teutonism
common in America. Do not say “He has a
<i>couple</i> of dollars in the bank”; say rather, “He has
some money in the bank.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#couple">COUPLE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>courage</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bravery">BRAVERY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>courier</b>, <b>currier</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. A <i>courier</i> is a special messenger sent
express with letters or despatches; an attendant on
a party of travelers. A <i>currier</i> is a man who dresses
leather or combs a horse.</p>

<p><b>covey</b>: As this word means “a brood or hatch of
birds,” especially quails or partridges, it should not be
applied to persons or things as is done by Thackeray
in “The Virginians,” ch. 27.</p>

<p><b>creditable</b> is sometimes confounded with <b>credible</b>,
but the one word means that which redounds to one’s
credit, whereas the other signifies that which is
worthy of belief.</p>

<p><b><a id="crime"></a>crime</b>, <b>sin</b>, <b>vice</b>: Exercise care in the use of these
words. <i>Crime</i> is an abstractly, flagrant violation of
law or morality in general; <i>sin</i>, disagreement in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
word, thought, deed, or desire, whether by omission
or commission, with the divine law; <i>vice</i> is the habitual
deviation from moral rectitude.</p>

<p><b>crow</b>, a colloquialism for <i>exult</i>.</p>

<p><b>crush</b> implies to force out of shape, therefore, it is
pleonastic to say “<i>crush out</i>,” of a mutiny.</p>

<p><b>cultivation</b>, <b>culture</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. While one of the various senses
of <i>cultivation</i> is culture, <i>culture</i> should be used only
of the development of the individual.</p>

<p><b>cunning</b>, meaning “artful,” and by extension “innocently
artful,” and hence “bright,” “amusing,”
or “characterized by quaint and playful moods,”
is often improperly introduced to imply “dainty,”
“choice,” especially if applied to anything diminutive.
Such usage is not permissible. A kitten may
properly be said to be <i>cunning</i>, but not a brooch,
although (in archaic usage) that may exhibit the
<i>cunning</i> or skill of the artificer.</p>

<p><b>curious</b>, in such expressions as “It is a <i>curious</i>
fact” has been hypercritically censured. The propriety
of the usage is unquestionable. “<i>Curious</i>
first ... denoted a state of mind, interest or diligence
in inquiry or prosecution; then it was predicated
of things which exhibit evident tokens of care
(<i>cura</i>), dextrous application, ingenuity; and, as such
things are out of the common and are apt to arrest
attention, it naturally acquired the sense of ‘novel,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
‘unusual,’ or more generally ‘novel and noticeable.’”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Fitzedward
Hall</span>, <i>False Philology</i>, p. 25.</p>

<p><b>cuss</b>: A vulgar corruption of “curse,” designating
a worthless or disagreeable person, and as such
it should be avoided.&mdash;<b>To cuss and swear</b>, that is,
“to use blasphemous language” is a phrase that
also should be avoided by persons having pretensions
to refinement.</p>

<p><b>custom</b>, <b>habit</b>: It is the <i>custom</i> of a person to do
a thing until it becomes a <i>habit</i>. From a voluntary
act of the will it has grown into an involuntary practise.
It will thus be seen that whereas a <i>custom</i> is
followed, a <i>habit</i> is acquired. Moreover, as involuntary
acts are not predicated of bodies of people,
<i>habits</i> are of necessity compared to individuals,
“The <i>custom</i> of social nipping tends to individual
<i>habits</i> of dissipation.”</p>

<p><b>customs</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#excise">EXCISE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>cut it out</b>, with the sense “eliminate,” is of recent
introduction and may be characterized as expressive
though inelegant.</p>

<p><b>cute</b>, which is an abbreviation of <i>acute</i> and means
“shrewd, smart, clever, or bright” is a colloquialism,
and as such is not favored in certain literary circles.</p>




<h2>D </h2>


<p><b>daisy</b>: A slang intensive, and as an equivalent
for “fine” or “charming,” applied to persons and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
things, sometimes carelessly as “a daisy time,” for
“a pleasant time.” In speaking of a woman, “Ain’t
she a <i>daisy</i>” is a vulgar way of saying “Isn’t she
charming.”</p>

<p><b>damage</b> should never be used for “cost” or
“charge.” <i>Damage</i> is injury or harm as to character,
person, or estate; <i>cost</i> and <i>charge</i> involve or
imply expenditure of money.</p>

<p><b>dance, to lead one a</b>: A colloquialism for “to
divert one from a desired course, and thus create
delay in its accomplishment.” There is but little in
the expression to recommend it.</p>

<p><b>dander</b> is a vulgarism for “anger” and as such
should not be used.</p>

<p><b>dangerous</b>: Avoid the vulgar use of this term in
the sense of “dangerously ill.” A man near death
may be dangerously ill, but he can not be <i>dangerous</i>.</p>

<p><b>dare</b>, <b>durst</b> or <b>dared</b>, <b>daring</b>: “You daresn’t”
“he durstn’t” are frequently used&mdash;the former always
incorrectly, the latter generally so; for in nine
cases out of ten, where the expression is used, the
speaker desires to signify the present and not the
past. The form is inelegant, but under certain conditions
may be grammatically correct. You dare
not; he dares not (daresn’t): this for the <i>present</i>.
In the <i>past</i> only, he durst not (or durstn’t).</p>

<p><b>dead</b>, <b>deceased</b>: Discriminate between these
words. One may refer correctly to a <i>dead</i> man or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
<i>dead</i> horse, but the word <i>deceased</i> is applied correctly
only to human beings.</p>

<p><b>dead slow</b>: A colloquialism for “lacking in spirit
or liveliness, dull or tedious;” applied indiscriminately
to persons or things.</p>

<p><b>deal</b>: Used sometimes loosely for <b>serve</b>. Do not
say “Deal the potatoes;” here <i>serve</i> is preferable.</p>

<p><b>debase</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#demean">DEMEAN</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>decease</b> should never be used as a verb.</p>

<p><b>deceive</b>: Deception implies the production of a
false impression. It is necessary, therefore, to distinguish
between the accomplishment of this object
and the bare attempt. Yet one frequently hears the
expression “he is deceiving me,” when it is clear that
(as the attempt is unsuccessful) the idea intended
to be conveyed is “he is attempting to <i>deceive</i> me.”</p>

<p><b>decided</b>, <b>decisive</b>: These terms are not exactly
synonymous. A <i>decided</i> fact is one that is unmistakable
and beyond dispute; a <i>decisive</i> fact is one that
terminates a discussion. A <i>decided</i> victory is not
necessarily a battle <i>decisive</i> of a campaign.</p>

<p><b><a id="deduction"></a>deduction</b> is frequently confounded with <b>induction</b>.
The <i>in-</i> mounts up from facts to law and
is the process of inferring general conclusions from
particular cases; the <i>de-</i> descends from law to facts
and is that which is deduced from premises or principles.
<i>Induction</i> is termed analysis; <i>deduction</i>, synthesis.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="deface"></a>deface</b>, <b>disfigure</b>: Discriminate between these
words. Persons <i>deface</i> things, for to <i>deface</i> implies
a deliberate act of destruction; but <i>disfiguration</i> may
take place to person or thing by the operation of
either. Thus, an inscription or bond is <i>defaced</i>, but
facial beauty is <i>disfigured</i> by smallpox or the weight
of care.</p>

<p><b>delicious</b>, <b>delightful</b>: These terms should be used
with discrimination. <i>Delicious</i> is correctly applied to
pleasures of the senses; <i>delightful</i> to that which
charms, gratifies, or gives pleasure. A dish may be
<i>delicious</i>, but not <i>delightful</i>; an entertainment may be
<i>delightful</i>, but is certainly not <i>delicious</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="delusion"></a>delusion</b>, <b>illusion</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. A <i>delusion</i> is a mental error arising
from false views or an unbalanced state of mind; an
<i>illusion</i> is an unreal image which is presented to the
senses. A mirage is an optical <i>illusion</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="demean"></a>demean</b> signifies “to behave” and does not
mean <i>debase</i> or <i>degrade</i>. A man <i>demeans</i> (<i>i. e.</i>,
comports) himself as a gentleman; but even if he
should <i>demean</i> himself as a churl, the verb would not
imply a lowering of his dignity or <i>debasement</i>; his
debasement would result alone from the conduct
he pursued.</p>

<p><b>denominate</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#nominate">NOMINATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>depositary</b>, <b>depository</b>: Discriminated in the best
usage, <i>depositary</i> denoting a person with whom, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
<i>depository</i> a place in which anything is deposited for
safe-keeping.</p>

<p><b>depravation</b>, <b>depravity</b>: These terms are not synonymous.
<i>Depravation</i> is the act or process of depraving
or corrupting; <i>depravity</i> is the condition of
being depraved.</p>

<p><b>desert</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#abandon">ABANDON</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>desert</b>, <b>dessert</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A <i>desert</i> is a barren waste; an uncultivated
and uninhabited wilderness; a <i>dessert</i> is a
service, as of fruits or sweetmeats, at the close of a
dinner.</p>

<p><b>despatch</b>: This word may be spelt correctly either
“despatch” or “dispatch,” notwithstanding the fact
that some writers condemn the word “dispatch.”</p>

<p><b>develop</b> is to “unfold” or “bring to light <i>by degrees</i>”
and should not be used for “expose” which
means to “reveal or lay bare,” without regard to
manner.</p>

<p><b>device</b>, <b>devise</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A <i>device</i> is something designed, invented,
or constructed for a special purpose or for
promoting an end, and may be used in either a good
or bad sense. A <i>devise</i> is a gift of lands by a last
will and testament. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bequest">BEQUEST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>die</b>: A word often misapplied especially by persons
accustomed to use inane superlatives as “She
died with laughing”; “I thought she’d have died.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<i>Die</i>, as a hyperbole, means, “to have a great desire
for,” and this sense is an undesirable perversion.</p>

<p><b>difference</b>: Careful note should be made of the
appropriate prepositions. The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>
says: “Difference <i>between</i> the old and the new;
differences <i>among</i> men; a difference <i>in</i> character; <i>of</i>
action, <i>of</i> style; (less frequently) a difference (controversy)
<i>with</i> a person; a difference <i>of</i> one thing
<i>from</i> (incorrectly <i>to</i>) another.”</p>

<p><b>different from</b>: <i>Different to</i>, though common in
England, is not sustained by good authority. The
best literary usage is uniformly <i>from</i>, following the
analogy of the verb <i>differ</i>; one thing <i>differs from</i> or
is <i>different from</i> another.</p>

<p><b>differ from</b>, <b>differ with</b>: One thing may differ <i>from</i>
another, or one person may differ <i>from</i> another, as in
physique; but one person may differ <i>with</i> another
in opinion.</p>

<p><b>dippy</b>: An extreme vulgarism for “mentally unbalanced.”</p>

<p><b>direct</b> should not be used where <i>address</i> is
intended. Do not say “<i>Direct</i> your letters to me
at Cook’s;” say, rather, “<i>Address</i> your letters,”
etc.</p>

<p><b>directly</b>, which means “in a direct or straight
course or manner,” and so “without medium,” has
not unnaturally been extended to signify “without
medium or intervention of time; immediately.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
American critics have objected to this use, but in
England it is popular.</p>

<p><b>disappoint</b>: Since <i>disappoint</i> implies frustration or
defeat, one cannot be <i>agreeably disappointed</i>; rather
agreeably <i>surprised</i>.</p>

<p><b>discharge</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#assume">ASSUME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>discreet</b>, <b>discrete</b>: Both words are derived from
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discretus</i>, pp. of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">discerno</i>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dis</i> + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cerno</i>, separate,
and formerly <i>discreet</i> was also spelt <i>discrete</i>, and even
had the meaning of “separate, distinct,” which sense
now belongs exclusively to <i>discrete</i>. <i>Discreet</i> is used
with the signification of “evincing discernment,
judicious, prudent.”</p>

<p><a id="discern_discriminate"></a><b>discern</b>, <b>discriminate</b>: The latter word is often
treated as synonymous with <i>distinguish</i>, and there is
etymological reason for this, as both words mean to
separate, but to <i>discern</i> is to “distinguish by the difference
or differences; differentiate.” “What we
<i>discern</i> we see apart from all other objects; what we
<i>discriminate</i> we judge apart, or recognize by some
special mark or manifest difference. We <i>discriminate</i>
by real differences; we <i>distinguish</i> by outward
signs.”</p>

<p><b>disfigure</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#deface">DEFACE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>disremember</b>: Avoid this term as provincial and
archaic, and use <i>forget</i> instead.</p>

<p><b>dissociate</b> is preferable to <i>disassociate</i>; for associate
is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad</i>, to, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socius</i>, united, whereas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
<i>dissociate</i> is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dis-</i>, used with separative
force, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">socius</i>. <i>Disassociate</i> is therefore nothing
more or less than uniting to and at the same time
severing from. The word, then, though used, is
illogically formed and should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>distinguish</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#discern_discriminate">DISCRIMINATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>divers</b>, <b>diverse</b>; By inattentive persons not infrequently
interchanged. <i>Divers</i> implies severalty;
<i>diverse</i>, difference. Hence we say; “The Evangelists
narrate events in <i>divers</i> manners,” but “The
views of the two parties were quite <i>diverse</i>.”</p>

<p><b>do</b>: Often used unnecessarily. Do not say, “I
shall succeed as others have <i>done</i> before me.” Here
“done” is pleonastic. But <i>do</i> may be used where it
is purely auxiliary to a missing verb, as “I shall
succeed as others <i>do</i>” (succeed).</p>

<p><b><a id="dock"></a>dock</b> is not a synonym for <i>wharf</i> although it is
often used as such. The <i>dock</i> is water, the <i>wharf</i>
is the abutting land or landing.</p>

<p><i>Dock</i> is by many persons used to mean a wharf
or pier; thus: “He fell off the <i>dock</i> and was
drowned.... A man might fall into a <i>dock</i>; but
to say that he fell off a <i>dock</i> is no better than to say
that he fell off a hole.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">R. G. White</span>, <i>Words and
Their Uses</i>, ch. 5. p. 107.</p>

<p><b>donate</b>: Incorrectly used as simply meaning <i>give</i>.
As meaning to <i>bestow as a gift</i> or <i>donation</i>, it has
been vehemently objected to by some critics, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the word has certainly acquired a place in popular
use, and is no more rendered unnecessary by the
previous existence of <i>give</i> than <i>donation</i> is by the
previous existence of <i>gift</i>. <i>Donate</i> should be used
of the bestowal of important, ceremonious, or official
gifts only.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>done</b>: Avoid using the past participle of verbs
instead of the imperfect. Do not say, “You <i>done</i>
it,” or “you <i>seen</i> it,” when you mean “you <i>did</i> it,”
or “you <i>saw</i> it.” Nor use the past tense for the
perfect participle, as in, “If you had <i>came</i>” when
you mean “If you had <i>come</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="dont"></a>don’t</b> is a contraction of <i>do not</i>, and in this sense
is permissible; but as signifying <i>does not</i>, the proper
contraction for which is <i>doesn’t</i>, its use is inaccurate.
In writing, the uncontracted forms are much to
be preferred, though in conventional speech the
abbreviations are accepted.</p>

<p><a id="dont_believe_dont_think"></a><b>don’t believe</b>, <b>don’t think</b>: “I <i>don’t believe</i> I’ll
go”; “I <i>don’t think</i> it will rain”; solecisms now in
almost universal use. Say, rather, “I believe I will
not go”; “I think it will not rain.”</p>

<p><b>don’t make no error</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#error_dont_you_make_no">ERROR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>dopey</b>: A vulgar substitute for “sleepy; dull;
thick-headed.”</p>

<p><b>dose</b>, <b>doze</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. That which a physician prescribes is a <i>dose</i>;
that which a sleepy patient may fall into is a <i>doze</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p><b>do tell!</b> An exclamation of surprise the equivalent
of which is “Is it possible!”&mdash;an inane provincialism
to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>doubt</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#whether">WHETHER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>doubt but that</b>: In this phrase <i>but</i> is superfluous
as it does not add anything to the sense.</p>

<p><b>dozen</b>: Exercise care in writing or uttering this
word. If a number precedes, then <i>dozen</i> forms the
correct plural: if not, the plural is formed by adding
an <i>s</i>. Say “six <i>dozen</i> sheep,” but “many <i>dozens</i> of
cattle.”</p>

<p><b>draft</b>, <b>draught</b>: Exercise care in using these words.
A <i>draft</i> is an order drawn by one person or firm on
another for the payment of money to a third; a
<i>draught</i> is a current of air passing through a channel
or entering by an aperture. These words are pronounced
alike and modern American practise favors
the spelling of <i>draft</i> for both.</p>

<p><b><a id="drive"></a>drive</b>: Critics have seen fit to cavil at the distinction
between <i>drive</i> and <i>ride</i>, objecting that the
coachman <i>drives</i> the lady, and asking whether traveling
by train or trolley-car is a <i>ride</i> or <i>drive</i>. The popular
idea is that one <i>rides</i> in a public conveyance
but <i>drives</i> when in a private carriage. As a matter
of convenience, however, the old-time distinction
so far as it concerns <i>riding</i> on horseback and <i>driving</i>
in a carriage is good, and in no way encroaches on
the question of travel submitted. Horse-back exer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>cise
and a carriage drive are essentially exercises for
pleasure and so not to be confounded with travel; but
if there were no distinguishing expression for the
two, we should have to add a qualifying term to
“ride,” to indicate the form of recreation enjoyed.
Again, on the legal principle of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Qui facit per alium
facit per se</i> (He who does a thing by another does it
himself), the lady who commissions her coachman to
<i>drive</i>, is herself the author of his driving, and <i>drives</i>.</p>

<p><b>drunk</b>: In modern usage of the verb this word is
confined to the past participle. It is therefore not
now proper to say “They drunk his health” say,
rather, “They <i>drank</i> his health.” Do not say “I
have <i>drank</i>” when you mean “I have <i>drunk</i>.”</p>

<p><b>dry up!</b> A vulgar imperative for “be quiet” or
“stop talking” and as such not used in refined
circles.</p>

<p><b>dubersome</b>: Of a vacillating nature, doubtful: an
absurd corruption of <i>dubious</i> to be avoided.</p>

<p><a id="due_owing"></a><b>due</b>, <b>owing</b>: Words now often used interchangeably.
<i>Due</i> should be limited in its use to that which
has to be paid, the word <i>owing</i> being indicative
of the source of the existing condition. An obligation
may be discharged as being <i>due</i> to a man’s
estate or his character. A man’s wealth is <i>owing</i> to
inheritance, good fortune, toil or thrift.</p>

<p><b>Dutch</b>: Often misapplied to the Germans from a
mistaken idea of the spelling of the German word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Deutsch</i>. The Dutch are Hollanders, and the Germans
are “Deutsch” in Germany.</p>




<h2>E </h2>


<p><b>each</b>, <b>every</b>: These words should never be used
with pronouns or verbs in the plural.</p>

<p><b><a id="each_other"></a>each other</b>: Strictly applied to two only, whereas
<i>one another</i> implies more than two. “The two
friends congratulated <i>each other</i>” (<i>i. e.</i>, each one the
other). “This commandment I give unto you that
ye love one <i>another</i>:” Yet this expression is now
used carelessly as a reciprocal pronoun; and Whittier
writes “To worship rightly is to love <i>each other</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="effect"></a>effect</b>, <b>affect</b>: Distinguish carefully between these
terms. To <i>effect</i> means to accomplish; to <i>affect</i>, to
influence. By concerted action men may <i>effect</i> reforms
which shall <i>affect</i> their condition.</p>

<p><b>effluvia</b>: A word often used incorrectly from the
mistaken idea that it is of the singular number. Do
not say “What a disagreeable <i>effluvia</i>” when you
wish to draw attention to an unpleasant smell. If
you must use the word, say “<i>effluvium</i>.”</p>

<p><b>egg</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bad_egg">BAD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>either</b>: An adjective denoting “one or the other
of two” often used incorrectly with a plural verb;
as, “Either <i>are</i> likely to sail.” Now, inasmuch as
“either” means “one or <i>the other</i>” of two the verb in
the sentence should be in the singular and to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
correct the sentence should be “Either <i>is</i> likely to
sail.” However, in its best and strictest usage <i>either</i>,
as has already been said, means “one or the other
of these,” as, “<i>either</i> horn of a dilemma”; but there
is authority for its use as “any” and “each of
two” or “both.” The former of these is, however,
a distinctly improper use, and the latter&mdash;though
sanctioned by “on <i>either</i> side one, and Jesus in the
midst,” (<i>John</i> xix, 18) is better left unsaid.</p>

<p><b>either you or I are (am or is) right</b>: Which should
it be? You <i>are</i>; I <i>am</i>; who <i>is</i>&mdash;which of the two?
The complete sentence is clearly “Either you (are
right) or I (am right).” If the pronoun had been
coupled, as in “Both you and I” the plural verb
would of course follow; but the very fact of this
would seem to indicate that where they are distinctly
disjoined, as here, the verb should not be plural
and should therefore be singular. Yet who could
say “either you or I <i>am</i> right.” Peculiar as it is&mdash;it
being impossible to say either “you is” or “I
is” the solution is to be found in the use of <i>is</i>; and
the correct rendering is, “Either you or I&mdash;one of
us,&mdash;<i>is</i> right.” Dr. Latham cites the rule thus,
“Wherever the word <i>either</i> or <i>neither</i> precedes the
pronouns, the verb is in the third person.” He adds
a second rule to the effect that if the disjunctive is
without the word <i>either</i> or <i>neither</i>, then the verb
agrees with the first of the two pronouns. He would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
therefore say “either you or I <i>is</i> right,” but “you
or I <i>are</i> right.” It is, however, questionable whether
usage bears with him.</p>

<p><a id="elder_eldest_older_oldest"></a><b>elder</b>, <b>eldest</b>; <b>older</b>, <b>oldest</b>: Discriminate carefully
between these terms. <i>Elder</i> and <i>eldest</i> are correctly
applied only to persons and usually only to persons
in the same family, as, “his <i>elder</i> brother.” <i>Older</i>
and <i>oldest</i> are used of persons or things without any
restriction, “the <i>oldest</i> inhabitant”; “the older <i>road</i>
is now closed.”</p>

<p><b>elegant</b>: Often misused for <i>pleasant</i>. <i>Elegant</i> refers
to qualities of refinement, grace, taste or polish.
One may say “an <i>elegant</i> gown”; “an <i>elegant</i> outfit”;
but not “an <i>elegant</i> time” nor “an <i>elegant</i> view.”</p>

<p><b><a id="else"></a>else</b>: E. S. Gould and certain other critics take
exception to a possessive use of this word, upon
which the former says “A comparatively modern and
a superlatively ridiculous custom has been introduced
by putting not the noun but the adjective, <i>else</i>, in the
possessive case.... <i>Else</i>, in the way it is used,
means besides ... [one] might as well say somebody
besides’s, etc. The proper construction of the
several phrases is somebody’s else, nobody’s else.”</p>

<p>On this subject the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says:
“The expressions <b>some one else</b>, <b>any one else</b>, <b>every
one else</b>, <b>somebody else</b>, which are in good usage,
are treated as substantive phrases and have the possessive
inflection upon <i>else</i>; as, <i>somebody else’s</i> um<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>brella;
but some people prefer to treat them as elliptical
expressions; as, the umbrella is <i>somebody’s</i> else
(<i>i. e.</i>, other than the person previously mentioned).”</p>

<p><b>embryo</b>: The plural of this word is formed by the
adding of “s” not “es” as in <i>potatoes</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="emerge"></a>emerge</b>, <b>immerge</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. To <i>emerge</i> is to come out of; issue or
proceed from something; to reappear as in a new
state; as, “the butterfly <i>emerges</i> from the chrysalis.”
To <i>immerge</i> is to plunge into anything, especially a
fluid; or to disappear; as, “some heavenly bodies
<i>immerge</i> in the light of the sun.”</p>

<p><b><a id="emigrant"></a>emigrant</b>, <b>immigrant</b>: These words are to be
carefully distinguished with regard, not to the person
but to the country from which or to which a person
comes. The <i>e</i> = <i>ex</i>, out of; the <i>im</i> = <i>in</i>, into. The
<i>emigrant</i> from Ireland is an <i>immigrant</i> when he lands
in New York.</p>

<p><b><a id="eminent"></a>eminent</b>, <b>imminent</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Eminent</i> means distinguished,
prominent, conspicuous. <i>Imminent</i> means impending;
threatening.</p>

<p><b>endorse</b>, <b>indorse</b>: From the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in</i>, on, and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dorsum</i>,
back, means to write or place upon the back of.
It is therefore pleonastic to say, as is frequently
done, “<i>indorse</i> on the back of.”</p>

<p>The spelling <i>indorse</i> which follows the medieval
Latin is that preferred in law and commerce; <i>endorse</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
a spelling which follows middle English analogy,
is the preferred form according to literary
usage.</p>

<p><b>enjoy</b>: A word often misused. Do not say
“I enjoy bad health” nor “I enjoy good health,”
when you suffer from illness or are in a perfect
state of health. One enjoys health (here
good is superfluous), but how can one <i>enjoy</i> bad
health?</p>

<p><b>enthuse</b>, said to be of journalistic origin, is characterized
as slang by the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>,
meaning “manifest enthusiasm or delight.”</p>

<p><b><a id="enthusiast"></a>enthusiast</b>, <b>fanatic</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. An <i>enthusiast</i> is one who is
ardently zealous in any pursuit; a <i>fanatic</i> is one
whose mind is imbued with excessive or extravagant
notions on religious subjects.</p>

<p><b>epithet</b>: Often misused from the mistaken idea
that an epithet must necessarily be opprobrious in
character or imply opprobrium. An epithet is an
adjective or a phrase or word used adjectively to describe
some quality or attribute of its object, as in
“a <i>benevolent</i> man,” “<i>Father</i> Æneas,” “benevolent”
and “father” are epithets.</p>

<p><b>equally as well</b>: An erroneous phrase rendered
correctly <i>equally well</i>. The introduced conjunction
has no grammatical place in the sentence, the meaning
of which is clear without it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p><b>equanimity of mind</b>. A pleonasm since equanimity
means “evenness of <i>mind</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="error_dont_you_make_no"></a>error, don’t you make no</b>: An ungrammatical and
therefore incorrect phrase sometimes used to assert
a fact; say, rather, “make no error.”</p>

<p><b><a id="eruption"></a>eruption</b>, <b>irruption</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. An <i>eruption</i> is a bursting forth
as from inclosure or confinement. An <i>irruption</i> is a
sudden incursion; an invasion.</p>

<p><b>eternal</b>, <b>everlasting</b>: Distinguish carefully between
these words. That which is <i>eternal</i> is without beginning
or end; that which is <i>everlasting</i> is without
end only.</p>

<p><b>euphemism</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#euphuism">EUPHUISM</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="euphuism"></a>euphuism</b> is often improperly used for <i>euphemism</i>.
Added to the Greek <i>eu</i>, well, is <i>phyē</i>, nature, in the
former, and <i>phēmi</i>, speak, in the latter. The former
is general and denotes a style, an affectation of
speech or writing, whereas <i>euphemism</i> is particular
and denotes a figure of speech.</p>

<p><b>evacuate</b> should be distinguished from <b>vacate</b>.
<i>Evacuate</i> does not mean to go away but to make
empty; and when the word is used in regard to
military movements, evacuation is a mere consequence,
result, or at most, concomitant of the going
away of the garrison. (<span class="smcap">R. G. White</span>, <i>Words and
Their Uses</i>, ch. 5, p. 109.) To <i>vacate</i> is to surrender
possession by removal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p><b>event</b>: Care should be exercised in the use of
this word. It means strictly a happening; that
which happens or comes to pass as distinguished
from a thing that exists. In interlocutory proceedings
a defendant was granted costs (which happened
to be considerable) <i>in any event</i>. The
plaintiff was shrewd enough to drop all further
proceedings, and consequently there was no <i>event</i> so
the heavy costs which he would have had to pay fell
upon his opponent.</p>

<p><b>eventuate</b>: Although some writers condemn the
use of this word as a synonym for “happen” the
use is recorded by modern dictionaries and may be
considered good English. Originally and in a restricted
sense <i>eventuate</i> meant “to culminate in some
result”; now, it means also “to be the issue of.”</p>

<p><b>even up</b>: A slang expression much used in the
South and West to signify “get even with; exact
compensation from”: an undesirable phrase.</p>

<p><b>ever</b>: Where <i>ever</i> is intended to be used as an
adverb of degree and not an adverb of time, it is
improper to substitute <i>never</i> (not ever) for the word.
If the substitution be made, it must be with the understanding
that the thought of the sentence is
changed from degree to time. “If he run <i>ever</i> so
well, he can not win” is not correctly expressed by
“If he run <i>never</i> so well,” etc., unless the thought
intended to be conveyed is “If he run, and run so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
well, as <i>never</i> in his life before, he can not win.”
The tendency has been to use both <i>ever so</i> and <i>never
so</i> loosely and vaguely.</p>

<p><b>ever so</b>: The phrases <i>ever so great</i>, <i>little</i>, <i>much</i>,
<i>many</i>, etc., meaning “very” or “exceedingly great,”
etc., may be carefully discriminated from <i>never so
great</i>, <i>little</i>, etc., meaning “inconceivably great,
little,” etc. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#never_so">NEVER SO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>every</b>: A collective pronominal singular that is
sometimes incorrectly used with a verb in the plural.
Do not say “Every passenger of the two hundred
aboard <i>were</i> detained at the dock.” Say, rather,
“Every passenger ... <i>was</i> detained.”</p>

<p><b>every confidence</b>: The phrase is objected to by
some critics on the ground that “<i>every</i> is distributive,
referring to a number of things that may be considered
separately, while confidence is used as a mass-noun.”
The adjective, therefore, as signifying <i>all</i> or
<i>entire</i>, is not permitted, though the phrase is accepted
by many as being elliptical, the words “sort of”
being understood after <i>every</i>; but <i>implicit confidence</i> is
a preferable phrase.</p>

<p><b>every which way</b>: A pleonastic colloquialism for
“every way”; “in all directions”; either of which
phrases may be used in preference.</p>

<p><b><a id="evidence"></a>evidence</b>, <b>testimony</b>: These words are often used
as if they were interchangeable. Greenleaf says
“<i>Testimony</i>, from the Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">testis</i>, a witness, is, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>ever,
only a species of evidence through the medium
of witnesses. The word <i>evidence</i>, in legal acceptation,
includes all the means by which any alleged
matter of fact, the truth of which is submitted to investigation,
is established or disproved.” (<i>Evidence</i>,
vol. i. ch. 1, p. 3.) Again “<i>Evidence</i> rests upon our
faith in human <i>testimony</i>, as sanctioned by experience”
(vol. i. ch. 10, p. 70). We may have the <i>testimony</i> of
a traveler that a fugitive passed his way; but his
footprints in the sand are <i>evidence</i> of the fact.</p>

<p><b>evident</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#apparent">APPARENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>exasperate</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#aggravate">AGGRAVATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>executer</b>, <b>executor</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. An <i>executer</i> is one who performs
some act; a doer. An <i>executor</i> is one who in law
administers an estate.</p>

<p><b>exceed</b>, <b>excel</b>: Formerly <i>exceed</i> (from the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex</i>, forth, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cedo</i>, go, = to go beyond the mark) had
for one of its meanings <i>excel</i> (from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ex</i>, out,
+ <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">celsus</i>, raised, = to go beyond in something good
or praiseworthy; outdo). Now these words must be
distinguished. This is to be particularly noted in
the derivatives <i>excessive</i> and <i>excellent</i>&mdash;the former
signifying an excess in that which ought not to be
exceeded, the latter in that where it is praiseworthy
to exceed. It is, therefore, not correct to speak of
weather as being <i>excessively</i> cold; say rather, <i>very</i> or
<i>exceedingly</i> cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p><b>except</b>, <b>unless</b>: These words are not synonymous.
Avoid such locutions as “You will not enjoy it <i>except</i>
you earn it.” Say rather, “You will not enjoy it
<i>unless</i> you earn it.”</p>

<p><b>exceptionable</b> is to be distinguished from <b>exceptional</b>.
<i>Exceptionable</i> conduct is that which is out of
the common and forms the exception to the rule.</p>

<p><b><a id="excise"></a>excise</b>, <b>customs</b>, <b>tolls</b>: Distinguish from each
other. Mill in his “Political Economy” says:</p>

<p>“Taxes on commodities are either on production
within the country, or on importation into it, or on
conveyance or sale within it, and are classed respectively
as <i>excise</i>, <i>customs</i>, or <i>tolls</i> and transit
duties.” (bk. v. ch. 3, p. 562.)</p>

<p>Thus, <i>excise</i> is a charge on commodities of domestic
production; <i>customs</i> is a charge or duty assessed
by law levied on goods imported or exported;
<i>tolls</i> are charges for special privileges as, passing over
a bridge or a turnpike.</p>

<p><b>excite</b>, <b>incite</b>: Exercise care in the use of these
words. <i>Excite</i> means to produce agitation or great
stir of feeling in; <i>incite</i> is to rouse to a particular
action.</p>

<p><b>exemplary</b> should not be used for “excellent.”
That which is <i>exemplary</i> serves as a model or an example
worthy of imitation: that which is <i>excellent</i>
possesses distinctive merit or excels that which is
good or praiseworthy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p><b>exodus</b>: Sometimes misused for <b>exit</b> or <b>departure</b>.
Do not say “I made a hasty <i>exodus</i>”; say, rather,
“My <i>exit</i> (or <i>departure</i>) was hasty.”</p>

<p><b>expect</b> is commonly misused for <i>think</i>, <i>believe</i>, <i>suppose</i>;
also for <i>suspect</i>. <i>Expect</i> refers to the future,
not to the past or present, usually with the implication
of interest or desire. Yet “I <i>expect</i> it is,” or
even “I <i>expect</i> it <i>was</i>,” is very common.</p>

<p><b>expect likely</b>, <b>expect probably</b>. The <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> says of these careless locutions, it is not
the expectancy, but the future event, that is <i>likely</i> or
<i>probable</i>. One may say “I think it is <i>likely</i>,” “I think
it [the act, event, or the like] <i>probable</i>,” or “It seems
<i>likely</i>” or “<i>probable</i>.” When another person’s expectancy
is matter of conjecture, one may say “You
<i>probably expect</i> to live many years”; <i>i. e.</i>, “<i>I think it
probable</i> that <i>you expect</i>,” etc.; but “Probably you
expect,” etc., would be better.</p>




<h2>F </h2>


<p><b>face the music</b>: Slang for to confront with boldness
anything of an unpleasant character or any
task especially difficult: a metonymic but inelegant
phrase.</p>

<p><b><a id="fade_away"></a>fade away</b>: In modern parlance a slang phrase
first introduced by Thackeray (<i>Vanity Fair</i>, ch. 60,
p. 540), and meaning “disappear or vanish mysteriously.”
The phrase is in good usage, however, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
the sense of “to pass away gradually; vanish; die
out;” as, “religious animosity would of itself <i>fade
away</i>” (<span class="smcap">Macaulay</span>, <i>Hist. of England</i>, vol. 2, p. 134).</p>

<p><b>faint</b>, <b>feint</b>, and <b>feign</b> all come from the French,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feindre</i>, which is derived from the Latin, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fingo</i>, shape.
The first two, similarly pronounced, have very different
significations. <i>Faint</i> means a sudden loss of
consciousness or swoon; <i>feint</i> signifies a deceptive
move or pretense. To <i>feign</i> is to make a false show
of; pretend.</p>

<p><b>fake</b>: Slang term for imposition; fraud; also,
fictitious or manufactured news. Expressive but inelegant.</p>

<p><b>fakement</b>: Slang for an act of fraud. Less desirable
than preceding and equally inelegant.</p>

<p><b>fanatic</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#enthusiast">ENTHUSIAST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>farewell</b>: When separated by a pronoun <i>farewell</i>
is written as two words; as, <i>fare you well</i>. Exception
has been taken to Byron’s pathetic lines</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse"><i>Fare thee well</i>, and if for ever,</div>
       <div class="verse">Then for ever, <i>fare thee well</i>;</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>but this is hypercriticism for here the pronoun is
nothing but the Anglo-Saxon dative.</p>

<p><b><a id="farther"></a>farther</b>, <b>further</b>: <i>Farther</i> should be used to designate
longitudinal distance; <i>further</i> to signify
quantity or degree. Thus, “How much <i>farther</i>
have we to go?” “Proceed no <i>further</i> along that
course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p><b>fault</b>: The different meanings of this word should
be clearly distinguished. A man perplexed or one
who has made a mistake is <i>at fault</i>; if he has done
anything for which he may be blamed he is <i>in fault</i>.
A hound is <i>at fault</i> when he has lost the scent.</p>

<p><b>faun</b>, <b>fawn</b>: Homophones each with a distinct
meaning. <i>Faun</i> is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Faunus</i>, god of
agriculture and of shepherds, and signifies a god of
the woods; <i>fawn</i>, from the Anglo Saxon <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">faegen</i>, fain,
signifies to seek favor by cringing and subserviency.</p>

<p><b><a id="favor"></a>favor</b> in the sense of “resemble” is a colloquialism,
the use of which is not recommended.</p>

<p><b>faze</b>, <b>feeze</b>: Slang terms for “disconcert” or
“confuse,” either of which is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b>feel to</b>: A colloquial expression meaning “to have
an impulse;” as “I <i>feel to</i> agree with you,” which
can not be too severely condemned.</p>

<p><b>feel bad</b>, <b>feel badly</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these terms. If you mean to express the idea
that you are ailing in health, <i>feel bad</i> is correct.
<i>Feel bad</i> is synonymous with <i>feel ill</i> and is correct.
One might as well say <i>feel illy</i> as <i>feel badly</i> if the latter
were correct as applied to health. However, <i>feel
badly</i> is correct when the intention is to say that
one’s power of touch is defective as through a mishap
to the fingers.</p>

<p><b>feel good</b>, <b>feel well</b>: Distinguish carefully between
these phrases. <i>Good</i> signifies having physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
qualities that are useful, or that can be made productive
of comfort, satisfaction, or enjoyment, as, a
<i>good</i> view, <i>good</i> flour; <i>well</i> signifies having physical
health, free from ailment; as, “two are sick, the
rest are <i>well</i>.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#good">GOOD</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="felicitate"></a>felicitate</b>, <b>congratulate</b>: The distinction in the
meanings of these words should be carefully noted.
To <i>felicitate</i> is to pronounce one happy and in the
strict sense, applies to self alone; <i>congratulate</i> is to
wish joy to another. In recent years <i>congratulate</i>
has been applied to one’s self, and <i>felicitate</i> to another;
thus the application of the meanings of these
words have been reversed by careless usage.</p>

<p>Trench says, “When I <i>congratulate</i> a person (<i>congratulor</i>)
I declare that I am sharer in his joy, that
what has rejoiced him has rejoiced me also.” <i>Gratulation</i>,
does not signify participation, and therefore, is
a mere <i>felicitation</i> (or admission of existing happiness
or cause for happiness) addressed to another.</p>

<p><b>female</b>: An opprobrious or contemptuous epithet
for woman. <i>Female</i> should be restricted to its correct
use. Do not say “With that modesty so characteristic
of a <i>female</i>”; say rather, “... so characteristic
of a woman.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#lady">LADY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>fermentation</b>, <b>fomentation</b>: Exercise care in the
use of these words. <i>Fermentation</i> is a chemical decomposition
of an organic compound; <i>fomentation</i>,
is the act of treating with warm water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p><b>fetch</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bring">BRING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="few"></a>few</b>: Sometimes used incorrectly for “in some
measure”; “to an extent”; “somewhat”; “rather”;
as, “Did you enjoy yourself?” “Just a <i>few</i>.” <i>Few</i>
is correctly applied to quantity and incorrectly to
quality; therefore, its use as in the illustration given
here is not good English.</p>

<p><b>few</b> and <b>a few</b> must not be confounded. “<i>Few</i>
men would act thus” means that scarcely any would;
but “<i>A few</i> men will always speak the truth” means
that there are some, though not many, whose custom
this is.</p>

<p><b>few</b>, <b>little</b>: The first of these words is sometimes
improperly used for the second. Measurement by
count is expressed by <i>few</i>, measurement by quantity
by <i>little</i>; as, “the loss of a <i>few</i> soldiers will make but
<i>little</i> difference to the result.” “The <i>fewer</i> his acquaintances,
the <i>fewer</i> (not the <i>less</i>) his enemies.”
<i>Few</i>, <i>fewer</i>, <i>fewest</i>, are correctly used in describing
articles the aggregate of which is expressed in numbers;
<i>little</i>, <i>less</i>, and <i>least</i> are used of objects that
are spoken of in bulk.</p>

<p><b>figure</b>: E. S. Gould and other critics object to the
use of the word in the sense of an amount stated in
numbers, as “Goods at a high <i>figure</i>.” But Dean
Alford is content to give his sanction to its use,
and the literary and general public have followed
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="final"></a>final</b>: Sometimes misused in such a sentence as
“the <i>final</i> completion of the work.” This is
inadmissible, for completion necessarily implies
finality.</p>

<p><b><a id="financial"></a>financial</b>, <b>monetary</b>, <b>pecuniary</b>: Discriminate carefully
between these words. <i>Financial</i> is applied correctly
to public funds or to the revenue of a government.
<i>Monetary</i> and <i>pecuniary</i> apply only to transactions
between individuals.</p>

<p><b>finish</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#complete">COMPLETE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>fire</b>: As this verb possesses the sense of impel, explode,
discharge, as by using fire; as, “<i>fire</i> a mine
or gun,” it has been humorously applied to discharge
from employment, as “<i>fire</i> a clerk.” But the
usage is slang, and as such is avoided by careful
speakers.</p>

<p><b><a id="first"></a>first</b>: Say the “<i>first</i> two” rather than the “two
<i>first</i>,” for unless they be bracketed equal there can
not be two <i>firsts</i>. For a similar reason the expression
seen in cars, “Smoking on the <i>four rear</i> seats,”
is equally incorrect. There can not be four <i>rear</i>
(or <i>last</i>) seats; but there can be “the <i>last four</i> seats.”
As meaning the four seats collectively which are situated
at the rear, the phrase has its only justification.</p>

<p><b>first</b> and <b>firstly</b>: <i>First</i> being an adverbial form
is the correct form to use. <i>Firstly</i> has been used by
Dickens, De Quincey, and others but in modern
usage <i>first</i> is the preferred form.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p><b>first-rate</b> is an adjectival not an adverbial expression.
One may say correctly, “He is a <i>first-rate</i>
walker,” but not that “he walks <i>first-rate</i>.”</p>

<p><b>fish</b>: When speaking of fish collectively this word
represents the plural; speaking of fish severally the
plural is formed by the addition of <i>es</i>.</p>

<p><b>fix</b>: The colloquial use of this noun for a position
involving embarrassment or a dilemma or predicament
has not the sanction of literary usage. Do not
say “I am in a bad <i>fix</i>” say, rather, “... in a
bad <i>condition</i>.” As a verb, it is better unused in the
sense of <i>set</i> or <i>arrange</i>. As meaning “put into
thorough adjustment or repair,” with the word <i>up</i>
added, it is sanctioned by popular usage; but the
expression is thought inelegant and indefinite. Some
more discriminating term is to be preferred. <i>Fix</i>,
in the sense of “disable, injure, or kill,” and “fix
up” in the sense of “dress elegantly,” are vulgarisms.</p>

<p><b>flap-doodle</b>: An inelegant term for “pretentious
silly talk characterized by an affectation of superior
knowledge.” <i>Twaddle</i> is a preferable synonym.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#flub-dub">FLUB-DUB</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>flash</b> for ostentatious display, as of money, is inelegant.
<i>Display</i> is a preferable word.</p>

<p><b>flew</b> is often misused for <i>fled</i>. Do not say “He
<i>flew</i> the city” when you mean that he <i>fled</i> from
it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p><b>flies on</b>: “There are no <i>flies on</i> him,” is a slang
phrase not used by persons accustomed to refined
diction.</p>

<p><b>flock</b>: A word sometimes misapplied. Do not
say “a <i>flock</i> of girls;” say, rather, “a <i>bevy</i> of
girls” and “a <i>flock</i> of sheep.” <i>Flock</i> is correctly
applied to a company or collection of small animals
as sheep, goats, rabbits, or birds.</p>

<p><b>flop</b> is an inelegant word used sometimes to denote
change of attitude on a subject. Do not say
“He <i>flopped</i> over to the other side”; say, rather,
“He went over....”</p>

<p><b><a id="flub-dub"></a>flub-dub</b>: A slang term used to designate a literary
work that is worthless.</p>

<p><b>flummux</b>: A vulgarism sometimes used for “perplex”
or “disconcert.”</p>

<p><b>fly off the handle</b>: A colloquial phrase meaning to
“lose one’s self control” as from anger.</p>

<p><b>folks</b>: The modern colloquial plural use of this
term is not to be recommended. The word is properly
used, both in singular and plural form, as <i>folk</i>,
its correct signification being “people, collectively or
distributively.”</p>

<p><b>foment</b>, <b>ferment</b>: Exercise care in the use of these
words. <i>Foment</i> is to bathe with warm or medicated
lotions; <i>ferment</i>, to cause chemical decomposition in.
Both words are also used figuratively.</p>

<p><b>fondling</b>, <b>foundling</b>: Discriminate carefully be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>tween
these words. A <i>fondling</i> is a person fondled
or caressed; a <i>foundling</i> is a deserted infant whose
parents are unknown.</p>

<p><b>fooling</b>: The use of the word in the sense of “deceiving”
has been condemned by certain writers as
a “very vulgar vulgarism,” but is permissible, having
the sanction not only of good literary authority but
of modern dictionaries. See Tennyson’s “Gareth
and Lynette” (st. 127): “Worse than being fool’d
of others is to fool one’s self.”</p>

<p><a id="for_and_to"></a><b>for</b> and <b>to</b>: These words are often added at the
end of a sentence by careless speakers but are redundant.
Do not say “Less than you think <i>for</i>”;
nor “Where are you going <i>to</i>?”</p>

<p><b><a id="forget_it"></a>forget it</b>: When used as the equivalent of “don’t
talk about it,” is a vulgarism that can not be too
severely condemned.</p>

<p><b>fork over</b>: Slang for “hand over,” a preferable
phrase.</p>

<p><b>former</b>: This word can refer to only one of two
persons or things previously mentioned, never to
any one of three or more. Avoid such construction
as the following: “Mr. Henley says that had Rosetti
and Byron been contemporaries, some of the <i>former’s</i>
(meaning Rosetti) verses would have caused the
latter (meaning Byron) to blush.” Here, <i>former</i> refers
to Mr. Henley, but the context shows clearly
the intention of the writer to refer to Rosetti.</p>

<p><b>forsake</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#abandon">ABANDON</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>fort</b>, <b>forte</b>: These two words similarly pronounced
must be distinguished. In each case the derivation
is the same (the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fortis</i> strong), and although
there is an alternative spelling of <i>fort</i> for “forte” it
is not the favored form. A <i>fort</i> signifies a fortification
held by a garrison; <i>forte</i> is that in which an
individual chiefly excels.</p>

<p><b>fracas</b>: A <i>fracas</i> is a brawl or an uproar, not a
part of the human anatomy. Therefore, avoid such
expressions as “He was stabbed in the fracas.”
Say, rather, “During the fracas he was stabbed.”</p>

<p><b>fraud</b>: Just as <i>cheat</i> has been made to do duty
both for the act and the person committing the act,
so in colloquial usage has <i>fraud</i> been made to represent
not only the act but also its perpetrator. It has
even been extended to “a deceptive or spurious
thing.” These usages of <i>fraud</i> are, however, not to
be recommended.</p>

<p><b><a id="freeze"></a>freeze</b>: This word has nothing in common with
<i>frieze</i> save the pronunciation. The former is an
Anglo-Saxon term, whereas the latter comes from
the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">frise</i>, for <i>fraise</i>, a ruff. To <i>freeze</i> is to
convert into ice, congeal; to <i>frieze</i> is to provide with
a <i>frieze</i>, which is, in architecture, the middle division
of an entablature.</p>

<p><b>freeze out</b>: A vulgar phrase for to “treat with
coldness, as of manner or conduct.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p><b>freeze to</b>: An inelegant colloquialism for “cling
to,” sometimes found in literature as in Kipling’s
“Mine Own People,” p. 209.</p>

<p><b>frequently</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#commonly">COMMONLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>fresh</b> in the sense of “full of ignorant conceit and
presumption” is slang and as such is avoided by
persons careful with their diction.</p>

<p><b><a id="friend"></a>friend</b>: Carefully distinguish between <i>friend</i> and
<i>acquaintance</i>. The former is an acquaintance who
has been admitted to terms of intimacy, and who is
regarded with a certain amount of affectionate regard.
A person to whom one has received a bare
introduction is an acquaintance&mdash;nothing more.</p>

<p><b>frieze</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#freeze">FREEZE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>from</b>: A preposition often incorrectly used for
“of.” <i>From</i> should not be used elliptically. Do
not say “He died <i>from</i> pneumonia” when you mean
“<i>from the effects of</i> pneumonia.” Here <i>effect</i> suggests
the cause from which the result proceeded. “He
died <i>of</i> pneumonia” is correct.</p>

<p><b>froze</b>: A term sometimes misused for frozen.
<i>Froze</i> is the imperfect of the verb <i>freeze</i>, while <i>frozen</i>
is a participial adjective. It is incorrect to say,
“My hands are <i>froze</i>,” here <i>frozen</i> should be used.</p>

<p><b><a id="ful"></a>-ful</b>. The plural of compounds ending in <i>-ful</i>, as
<i>spoonful</i> is formed in the same manner as the plural
of other nouns of regular formation&mdash;by the simple
addition of a final “s,” as, <i>spoonfuls</i>. So when a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
physician prescribes medicine to be taken by the
spoonful more than once a day, these are correctly
spoken of as <i>spoonfuls</i>. But supposing more than
one medicine is to be taken and that the medicines
do not assimilate thus requiring <i>more than one spoon</i>
to administer them; then it would be correct to refer
to the different doses as <i>spoons full</i>, since the words
denote more than one spoon full. <i>Spoonfuls</i> denote
one spoon filled more than once.</p>

<p><b>fulfil</b>: Remember that in this word the “l” is not
doubled but that it is in <i>fulfilling</i>.</p>

<p><b>full</b>, <b>fuller</b>: Terms sometimes incorrectly used.
A “<i>full</i> cup,” is a cup completely filled, therefore
it would seem illogical to say “my cup is <i>fuller</i>
than yours.” As a rule all words that in themselves
express the idea of completion or perfection
should be used only in the positive degree. A
perfection greater than itself is inconceivable, yet
in literature, and with speakers who are accustomed
to a careful choice of words, this form of
expression has been permitted for comparison in
the absence of an absolute standard of measurement.</p>

<p><b>full</b>: A coarse substitute for “intoxicated.”</p>

<p><b>funeral</b>: A term sometimes misused for “affair,”
or “business,” as in the phrase “Not my <i>funeral</i>”
meaning “No business of mine.” The use is not
to be commended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p><b>funny</b>: As a colloquialism signifying “queer” this
adjective should be used with care. It is better retained
for signification of that which is mirth-provoking
or ludicrous. <i>Funny</i> is sometimes used incorrectly
to imply silly impropriety, as in the phrase,
“Don’t get <i>funny</i>.” Such usage should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>further</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#farther">FARTHER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>future, the</b>: Used sometimes to signify the present;
as, “I <i>shall be</i> happy to accept”&mdash;this is not
what is meant. The meaning is “I <i>am</i> happy to
accept, for I <i>shall be</i> happy to come,” or “(Because)
I shall be happy to (come I am happy to) accept”;
and the elliptical result is that there is elision of the
words in parentheses. In a recent lawsuit the plaintiff
lost $10,000 because a so-called guarantee was
given in these terms: “I <i>will</i> guarantee” instead
of “I (hereby <i>do</i>) guarantee.” The guarantee provided
had never been asked for, given, or obtained.
The credulous victim had accepted a promise, without
condition, for a performance; and he lost. Time
has improved his knowledge of the force of the English
tongue.</p>




<h2>G </h2>


<p><b>galaxy</b>: Exercise care in the use of this word. It
signifies any brilliant circle or group; as, a <i>galaxy</i> of
beauties or of gems, and is never correctly used of
any person or thing of inferior quality.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p><b>gall</b>: Correctly used is “an intensely bitter feeling.”
When used as a synonym for “cool assurance” or
“impudence” it is slang which should be avoided.</p>

<p><b>gang</b> is correctly applied to a squad of laborers,
and others detailed to certain given tasks. But
sometimes applied also, usually in an uncomplimentary
way, to a company of persons who meet habitually
for social intercourse; as, “He sent a letter to
the <i>gang</i> at Seelig’s.”</p>

<p><b>gazebo</b>: A term often misused for “chief person.”
A <i>gazebo</i> is a belvedere or elevated summer-house
and as such is often the highest point of a building:
applied to a person the term is slang.</p>

<p><b>gee whiz</b>: A slang exclamation of astonishment
that it is best to avoid.</p>

<p><b>geezer</b>: A vulgar term applied, usually in derision
to elderly persons, particularly women. Formerly
it was used to designate a mummer or other
grotesque character.</p>

<p><b>generally</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#commonly">COMMONLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>genius</b>, <b>genus</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Genius</i> implies the possession of remarkable
natural gifts through which their possessor
may attain ends or obtain results by intuitive power.
<i>Genus</i> is a class or kind. In the natural sciences it
is the subordinate of an order, tribe, or family.</p>

<p><b><a id="gent"></a>gent</b>: As an abbreviation for <i>gentleman</i> this word
is not permitted in refined speech; and <i>gentleman</i> is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
never correctly used for <i>man</i> as a mere indication of
sex. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#lady">LADY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>genteel</b> is sometimes improperly applied to persons
who are preferably spoken of as polite or well-bred.
If used with regard to persons, it should only be in
connection with some specific characteristic, as “a
person of <i>genteel</i> speech or appearance,” or to indicate
suitability to the condition of a well-bred person,
as in the expression “a <i>genteel</i> fortune.”</p>

<p><b>genuine</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#authentic">AUTHENTIC</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>get a gait</b> or <b>move on</b>: Slang phrases for “hasten
one’s steps or actions,” which, while it may not be
so expressive, is more elegant and refined.</p>

<p><b>get over</b>: Sometimes used for <i>deny</i> or <i>refute</i>. One
doesn’t get over a charge but <i>refutes</i> it.</p>

<p><b>git</b>: Vulgarism used in the imperative for <i>get out</i>.</p>

<p><b>go</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#went">WENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="go_back_on"></a>go back on</b>: A colloquialism for abandon, deceive,
play false. Inelegant and not used by persons accustomed
to nice discriminations of speech.</p>

<p><b><a id="going"></a>going</b> is sometimes used as a synonym for <i>just
about</i>. One frequently hears, “I am just going to
sing,” from a person who is <i>about to</i> do so. The
verb <i>go</i>, in the transitive, is sometimes used loosely
in the colloquial sense of “endure” or “wager.”
Polite speech does not sanction such locutions as “I
can not <i>go</i> that music;” “I will <i>go</i> you a dollar on
the race.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p><b>gone</b>: The phrase “He’s been <i>gone</i> this month,”
though frequently used, is better rendered thus: “It’s
a month since he went.” The verb “to go” does
not lend itself agreeably to this treatment which is
common with other verbs (as “He has been known
and loved for years”), and the expression “this
month,” for “this past month,” is somewhat too
elliptical to be received with favor.</p>

<p><b>gone case</b>: A vulgarism sometimes used to denote
that the affection bestowed by one person on another
of the opposite sex shows him to be serious in his
intentions. It is also a vulgarism when applied to
one who is in a hopeless condition, as from illness.</p>

<p><b><a id="good"></a>good</b> should never be used for <i>well</i>. Do not say,
“I feel pretty <i>good</i>” or “she plays that pretty <i>good</i>”
when you mean that you “feel pretty <i>well</i>” or that
“she plays fairly <i>well</i>.”</p>

<p><b>go past</b>: “Go” usually implies motion forward,
therefore, it is pleonastic to say “go past.” Say,
rather, that you “go <i>by</i>” and not <i>past</i>. Nevertheless
a march <i>past</i> is a recognized expression.</p>

<p><b>got</b>: This word is used correctly for acquired or
obtained, but is incorrectly used to denote simple
possession and correctly implies <i>effort to secure</i>
something. Sometimes it is used redundantly; as,
“He has <i>got</i> it”; the simpler form, “He has it” is
preferable. “We have <i>got</i> to do it,” while emphatic,
is less so than “we <i>must</i> do it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p><b>go the whole hog</b>: An inelegant phrase used for
“to go to the utmost limit.” Carlyle traces the
origin of this phrase from the Irish because in Ireland
<i>hog</i> was a synonym for a ten penny piece, a coin
once current in that country.</p>

<p><b>graduate</b>: The use of this verb in the intransitive
has been condemned by purists but is now well established.
Thus, one may correctly say “He <i>was
graduated</i> from a university” or, “<i>He graduated</i> from
a university.”</p>

<p><b>grammar</b>: The phrases <b>good grammar</b> and <b>bad
grammar</b> have been condemned as false syntax by
some persons unfamiliar with the meanings of the
word “grammar.” One meaning recorded by the
<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> is “speech or writing considered
with regard to its correctness; propriety of
linguistic usage; as, he uses <i>good</i> or <i>bad grammar</i>.”</p>

<p>The <i>New York Herald</i> (March 4, 1906) says:
“<i>Good grammar</i> is one of those cheap vulgarisms
which most offend the scholarly ear. A phrase is
either grammatical or ungrammatical. It can not be
characterized as either ‘good’ or ‘bad’ grammar.”</p>

<p>The writer of the foregoing based his criticism
on a misunderstanding. The word “grammar” is
not like the word “orthography,” a word made up of
<i>orthos</i>, correct, and <i>grapho</i>, to write. Grammar does
not carry with it the implication of correctness, and
modern grammarians bear this out. Prof. Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Maetzner in his “English Grammar: Methodical,
Analytical and Historical,” so defines the term:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“<i>Grammar</i>, or the <i>doctrine of language</i>, treats of the laws
of speech, and, in the first place, of the <i>Word</i>, as its fundamental
constituent, with respect to its <i>matter</i> and its <i>form</i>, in
<i>prosody</i>, or the doctrine of sounds, and <i>morphology</i>, or the
doctrine of forms, and then of the <i>combination</i> of words in
speech, in <i>syntax</i>, or the doctrine of the joining of words and
sentences” (vol. i. p. 12).</p></div>

<p>Syntax, which is a part of grammar, is sometimes
confused with grammar itself. It is that part of
grammar which treats of the sentence and of its construction,
and embraces, among other features, the
doctrine of the collocation of words in sentences in
connected speech, treating of their arrangement and
relative positions, as required by grammatical connection,
euphony, and clearness and energy of expression.</p>

<p>The “New English Dictionary,” edited at Oxford
University by Dr. J. A. H. Murray, treating this subject
says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The old-fashioned definition of grammar as ‘The art of
speaking and writing a language correctly’ is from the modern
point of view in one respect too narrow, because it applied
only to a portion of this branch of study; in another respect
it is too wide, and was so even from the older point of view,
<i>because many questions of ‘correctness’ in language are recognized
as outside the province of grammar</i>: <i>e. g.</i>, the use of a
word in a wrong sense, or a bad pronunciation or spelling,
would not have been called a grammatical mistake. Until a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
not very distant date, grammar was divided by English
writers into Orthography, Etymology, Syntax, and Prosody,
to which Orthoepy was added by some others. The division
now usual is that into Phonology, treating of the sounds now
used in the language, Accidence, of the inflexional forms or
equivalent combinations, and Syntax, of the structure of sentences.”</p></div>

<p>In defining grammar, Lindley Murray wrote “English
grammar is the art of speaking and writing the
English language with propriety.” Following the
style of the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>, Dr. Murray gives
one of the meanings of grammar as follows; “Speech
or writing judged as good or bad according as it conforms
to or violates grammatical rules; also speech
or writing that is correct according to those rules.”</p>

<p>If grammar can not be good or bad, as contended
by the <i>New York Herald’s</i> editor, then it can not be
true or false. Yet Dryden wrote, “And I doubt the
word ‘they’ is <i>false grammar</i>” (Almanzor, II. Def.
Epilogue); and Macaulay writing of Frederick the
Great, said: “He had German enough to scold his
servants, but his <i>grammar and pronunciation are extremely
bad</i>” (Essays; Frederick the Great). Again,
elsewhere, “The letter may still be read, with all
the original <i>bad grammar</i> and bad spelling” (History
of England, IV., xviii., 245). Both phrases are permissible.

precision.</p>

<p><b>grass, go to</b>: A vulgar imperative meaning “get

<p><b>grass widow</b>: A common term of disparagement
applied to a woman abandoned by or separated from
her husband: a term which is not used by persons
of refinement and one that, if used at all, should be
applied only with great care.</p>

<p><b>grass widower</b>: A term used to denote a husband
who lives apart from his wife or one from whom the
wife is temporarily absent.</p>

<p><b>gratitude</b>, <b>thankfulness</b>: Gratitude, from the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratitudo</i>, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">gratus</i>, kind, is a sense of appreciation
of favors received, as indicated by actions. It is
the actual feeling, of which <i>thankfulness</i>, or the fulness
of thanks, is the mere outward expression. It is
therefore quite possible, and indeed often the case,
for a person who at one time is <i>full of thanks</i> to
show subsequently a want of gratitude.</p>

<p><b>grouchy</b>: A slang term for sulky or disgruntled.</p>

<p><b>grow</b> sometimes used for <i>become</i> is gaining the
sanction of usage; as, “to <i>grow</i> smaller.” In this
sense <i>grow</i> has been used by such masters of English
as Steele, Gray, Johnson, and Macaulay.</p>

<p><b>guess</b>, <b>suppose</b>, <b>think</b>, <b>conjecture</b>: Words sometimes
used incorrectly. We <i>guess</i> when we are content
to hazard an opinion based on data which are
admittedly insufficient, but we <i>suppose</i> when we have
good ground for assuming a thing to be true. When
we <i>think</i>, we give thought to a matter on which we
yet admit the thought has been insufficient to furnish
us with exact or certain knowledge. <i>Thinking</i>
is allied to <i>conjecturing</i>, in which, though holding a
pronounced opinion, this falls short of absolute <i>conviction</i>.
We <i>guess</i> the outcome of an event, but <i>suppose</i>
that an event which has happened may result
in good. We <i>think</i> that a certain medicine may effect
a cure, but if we have tried it successfully before for a

being absolutely sure that the conditions are precisely
the same we are not <i>convinced</i> and do not <i>know</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="habit"></a>habit</b>, <b>custom</b>, <b>usage</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. In strict usage <i>habit</i> pertains
exclusively to the individual; <i>custom</i> to a race or
nation of people, as, the <i>customs</i> of the Jews. <i>Usage</i>
refers particularly to habitual practise or something
permitted by it or done in accordance with it.</p>

<p><a id="had_better_would_better"></a><b>had better</b>, <b>would better</b>: Although according
to grammatical rule <i>had better</i> is incorrect, it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
been used by writers of correct English and it
may be found repeatedly in the English Classics.
Therefore, it is generally considered good usage
and preferable to <i>would better</i> which, though correct,
is seldom heard and usually considered pedantic.</p>

<p><b>had</b>, <b>have</b>: In such a phrase as “<i>Had I have</i> heard
of it,” the verb <i>have</i> is redundant, for <i>had</i> here is
used elliptically for <i>if I had</i>, and carries the contingency
to the past. Care should be taken to avoid
such locutions as the example given which is one of
a class that stamps those who make use of them as
grossly ignorant.</p>

<p><a id="had_ought"></a><b>had ought</b>: The use of any part of the verb <i>have</i>
with <i>ought</i> is a vulgarism. Not “I <i>had ought</i> to have
written,” but simply “I <i>ought</i> to have written”; not
“He <i>hadn’t ought</i> to have done it,” but “He <i>ought
not</i> to have done it.”</p>

<p><b>had rather</b>, <b>had better</b>: Forms disputed by certain
critics, from the days of Samuel Johnson, the critics
insisting upon the substitution of <i>would</i> or <i>should</i>, as
the case may demand, for <i>had</i>; but <i>had rather</i> and
<i>had better</i> are thoroughly established English idioms
having the almost universal popular and literary
sanction of centuries. “I <i>would rather</i> not go” is
undoubtedly correct when the purpose is to emphasize
the element of choice or will in the matter; but
in all ordinary cases “I <i>had rather</i> not go” has the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
merit of being idiomatic and easily and universally
understood.</p>

<p>“<i>Would rather</i> may always be substituted for <i>had

<i>Would</i> and <i>should</i> do not go well with <i>better</i>.
In one instance <i>can</i> is admissible. ‘I can better

<p><b>hail</b>, <b>hale</b>: <i>Hail</i> is pronounced as <i>hale</i> (robust;
sound) but should be distinguished therefrom, although
for that word there is an alternative spelling
<i>hail</i>, which, however, is rarely used. <i>Hale</i> is from
Icelandish <i lang="is" xml:lang="is">heill</i>, sound; <i>hail</i> is from the Anglo-Saxon,
<i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">haegel</i>, frozen rain.</p>

<p><b>hain’t</b>: A common vulgarism for <i>have not</i>, <i>haven’t</i>,
and made worse, if possible, by being used also for
<i>has not</i> or <i>hasn’t</i>; as “I <i>hain’t</i>,” “He <i>hain’t</i>,” etc.
“I <i>haven’t</i>,” “He <i>hasn’t</i>,” are permissible, “<i>haven’t</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
I?” “<i>hasn’t</i> he?” are acceptable in conversation.
But when the subject precedes in the first person
singular and the plural, it is preferable to abbreviate
the verb; as, “<i>I’ve not</i>” “<i>you’ve not</i>,” etc.</p>

<p><b>half</b>: Inasmuch as in equivalent terms of the whole
there can not be a single <i>half</i> but must be two <i>halves</i>,
one should speak of dividing (the whole) into two
or into halves rather than of cutting (it) in <i>half</i>.</p>

<p><b>half-cock, to go off at</b>: A colloquial phrase denoting
“to speak before one is ready”; not used by
persons accustomed to refined diction.</p>

<p><b>handful</b>: This word has for a plural <i>handfuls</i>.
“Two <i>handfuls</i> of flour” means a handful taken
twice, whereas <i>hands full</i> means both hands full.
This last term is often erroneously written <i>handsful</i>.</p>

<p><b>handy</b>: Properly said of articles on which one
may lay the hand, or possibly of persons, as attendants,
ready at hand for service. Applied to neighborhood,
“near,” “near by,” “close at hand,” or
the like are to be preferred.</p>

<p><b><a id="hang"></a>hang</b>: This verb has for its perfect tense and past
participle two forms, <i>hanged</i> and <i>hung</i>; but in the
sense of execution (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sus per col</i>), the former term is
alone correctly used, whereas in other senses the
latter is applied. Thus, one may say, “A hat is
<i>hung</i> on a peg, but a murderer is <i>hanged</i> on the gallows,”
and <i>not</i> that the hat is hanged <i>nor</i> that the
murderer is hung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p><b>hanger on</b>: A colloquialism for “a dependent or

<p><b><a id="hasten"></a>hasten</b>, <b>hurry</b>: Although both words imply a celerity
of action, the former presupposes consideration
and is not opposed to good order, whereas the latter
is indicative of perturbation and a measure of irregularity.
Therefore these terms are not synonymous.
Phelps in his “English Style in Public Discourse,”
says “the first does not imply confusion; the second
does.” Lexicographers do not restrict the meaning
of <i>hurry</i> to “to confuse by undue haste or suddenness,”
but define it as “to cause to be done rapidly
or more rapidly; accelerate.” You <i>hasten</i> to congratulate
but <i>hurry</i> to catch a train.</p>

Dictionary</span> says; Used in the past tense following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
another past tense, a use often indiscriminately condemned,
though sometimes proper and necessary.
(1) <i>Improper construction.</i> Where what was “meant,”
“intended,” or the like was, at the time when intended,
some act (as of going, writing, or speaking)
<i>future</i> in its purpose and not <i>past</i>, and therefore not
to be expressed by a <i>past tense</i>; as, “He meant <i>to
have gone</i>” for “He meant <i>to go</i>”; “I meant <i>to have
written</i> to you, but forgot it,” for “I meant <i>to write</i>,”
etc.; “I had intended <i>to have spoken</i> to him about it,”
for “I had intended <i>to speak</i>,” etc.; “I should like
<i>to have gone</i>” for “I should have liked <i>to go</i>.” The
infinitive with <i>to</i> expresses the relation of an act as
so conceived, so that both analogy and prevalent
usage require “meant to go” instead of “meant to
have gone.” Such construction, although occasional
instances of it still occur in works of authors of the
highest literary reputation, and still often heard in
conversation, is now generally regarded as ungrammatical.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Proper construction.</i> The doubling of the past
tenses in connection with the use of <i>have</i> with a past
participle is <i>proper and necessary</i> when the completion
of the future act was intended before the occurrence
of something else mentioned or thought of. Attention
to this qualification, which has been overlooked
in the criticism of tense-formation and connection, is
especially important and imperative. If one says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
“I meant <i>to have visited</i> Paris and <i>to have returned</i> to
London before my father <i>arrived</i> from America,” the
past infinitive in the dependent clause is necessary
for the expression of the completion of the acts purposed.
“I meant <i>to visit</i> Paris and <i>to return</i> to
London before my father <i>arrived</i> from America,”
may convey suggestively the thought intended, but
does not express it.</p>

<p><b>have seen</b>, <b>seen</b>, <b>saw</b>: In combining words that
denote time always observe the order and fitness of
time. Do not say “I <i>have seen</i> him last month”; say,
rather, “I <i>saw</i> him <i>last month</i>.” Nor say, “I <i>seen</i>
him <i>this week</i>”&mdash;a common error in grammar among
the careless; say, rather, “I <i>have seen</i> him <i>this week</i>,”
a form that should be used also, instead of “I <i>saw</i>
him <i>this week</i>.”</p>

<p><b>he</b>, <b>she</b>, <b>her</b>, <b>him</b>, etc.: Pronouns often used incorrectly;
inexcusable errors in the educated, which are
illustrated by such expressions as “If I were <i>him</i> (or
<i>her</i>), I would,” etc. It should be “If I were <i>he</i> (or
<i>she</i>), I would,” etc.</p>

<p><b>healthful</b>, <b>healthy</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A <i>healthful</i> thing is one efficacious in
promoting or causing health; <i>healthy</i> denotes condition
or characteristics; as “a <i>healthy</i> child”; “a
<i>healthful</i> climate.”</p>

<p><b><a id="heap"></a>heap</b>: A word sometimes used to designate a
“large number.” A <i>heap</i> is “a collection of things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
piled up so as to form an elevation”; any other
application of the word is colloquial.</p>

<p><b>hearty</b>: As applied to the appetite is so common
at this day that it seems perhaps hypercritical to
object to it; and the dictionaries of course give the
sense, for it is the lexicographer’s duty to record the
language as it exists <i>not</i> as it ought to exist. That
is <i>hearty</i> which proceeds from the heart; to extend
the sentiment to the appetite, or to a meal, or to its
eater, as is done by common usage, seems taking a
liberty with the word, and applying a fine and expressive
term to a comparatively unworthy object.</p>

<p><a id="heir"></a><b>heir</b>: Pronounce without aspirating the <i>h</i>. Distinguish
between <i>heir apparent</i> and <i>heir presumptive</i>.
The former is “one who must by course of law become
the <i>heir</i> if he survive his ancestor”; the latter,
“one whose present legal expectation of becoming
heir may be defeated by the birth of a person in near
degree of relationship.” Thus, a man may to-day be
<i>heir presumptive</i> to his bachelor brother who by marriage
may in a year’s time become the father of a
son, who will then become <i>heir apparent</i>; and by this
circumstance the claims of the former <i>heir presumptive</i>
are quashed.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says: “<i>Heir</i> is often
colloquially applied to one who receives or is to receive
a property by will. In legal terminology such
a person is a <i>devisee</i> or legatee, not an <i>heir</i>.” As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
an <i>heir</i> does not exist till death either by will or
operation of law, it is only by impropriety of speech
that one talks of the heirs of the living.</p>

<p><b><a id="help"></a>help</b> has the meaning of “assist”; it has also the
somewhat opposed meaning of “prevent, hinder, or
refrain from.” This veiled negative makes the correct
application of the word difficult. Take, for example,
the sentence “Make no more noise than you
can <i>help</i>.” I can not <i>help</i> doing a thing is I can not
refrain from doing it: that is, I can not <i>not</i> do it,
which means I must do it. The correct form of the
sentence just given is shown by filling in the ellipsis,
whence it appears that <i>not</i> should also be supplied:
“Make no more noise than (such as) you can (<i>not</i>)
<i>help</i> (making).” <i>Help</i> includes <i>aid</i>, but <i>aid</i> may fall
short of the meaning of <i>help</i>.</p>

<p><b>hence</b>, <b>thence</b>, <b>whence</b>: As in meaning these words
embrace <i>from</i> it is pleonastic to precede them by
the word thus implied. Do not say, “go from
hence,” “from thence he went to Rome,” “from
whence did you come.” <i>From</i> is redundant in all
these sentences.</p>

<p><b>hen-party</b>: A vulgar term for a social gathering
of ladies. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase">STAG-PARTY</span>.</p>

<p><b>herd</b>: A term sometimes applied indiscriminately
to persons as well as beasts. <i>Herd</i> is correctly
used to designate, “a number of animals feeding
or herding together;” when applied to persons the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
true designation is “a disorderly rabble,” or “the
lower classes,” as the vulgar <i>herd</i>.</p>

<p><b>him and me</b>: It is a vulgar error to use the
objective for the nominative. One should not
say, “Him and me are going to Bermuda,” say,
rather, “He and I (or preferably ‘we’) are going
to Bermuda.” Do not say, “Between <i>you and
I</i>,” but say, “Between <i>you and me</i>,” or “Between
<i>us</i>.”</p>

<p><b>hire</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#lease">LEASE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>holocaust</b>: A term sometimes misused owing to a
lexicographical error which attributes to the word
the meaning of “any great disaster.” According to
this the Johnstown Flood, the Galveston storm, and
the fire in the Paris bazaar all were holocausts, but
this is erroneous. <i>Holocaust</i> is derived from the
Greek <i>holos</i>, entire, whole, and <i>kaustos</i>, burnt, and
its principal meaning is “a sacrificial offering burnt
whole or entirely consumed.” Figuratively, the term
may be applied to destruction by fire, as the burning
of the steamer “General Slocum” in the East River,
New York, or the great fire in Baltimore, but not to
loss as by shipwreck or collision unless attended by
fire.</p>

<p><b>holy</b>: The word means not only “morally excellent”
but also “set apart for the service of God”;
and therefore the criticism that “to keep <i>holy</i> the
Sabbath day” is a meaningless injunction as every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
day should be kept <i>holy</i>, is without merit. The word is
derived from the Anglo Saxon and means “whole”;
and the divine direction as to the Sabbath is, therefore,
simply that the day be observed in its integrity.</p>

<p><b>holy mackerel</b>: An inane expression commonly
used to denote surprise and one to be avoided by all
persons with pretentions to refined diction.</p>

<p><b>hoodoo</b>: A colloquialism designating any person
regarded as bringing ill luck, as a “Jonah,” on shipboard,
in allusion to the Bible story of the prophet
Jonah.</p>

<p><b>horde</b>: This word means “a gathered multitude
of human beings; a troop, gang, or crew; as the
<i>hordes</i> of Cambyses.” It is never correctly applied
to things. Do not speak of a <i>horde</i> of rubbish.</p>

<p><b>horse sense</b>: A colloquial phrase designating
“rough common sense” used by W. D. Howells in
“Hazard of New Fortunes,” vol. i. p. 4.</p>

<p><b>how?</b> should never be used for “What did you
say?” Nor in making a <i>request</i> for the repetition
of any statement not heard clearly or not readily
understood. Condemned by Oliver Wendell Holmes
in “A Rhymed Lesson,” st. 43.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
       <div class="verse indent8">“Do put your accents in the proper spot;</div>
       <div class="verse">Don’t&mdash;let me beg you&mdash;don’t say “How?” for “What?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b>how</b> is an adverb, but it is sometimes most inelegantly
used as an interjection and very improperly
used as a conjunction, which it is not. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
this subject the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says, “<i>How</i>,
as an adverb, may be used as an interrogative
or a relative in any of its senses. In old or vulgar
usage it is sometimes nearly equivalent to the conjunction
<i>that</i>: either (1) alone, as, he told me <i>how</i>
he had been left an orphan; or (2) in the phrases
<i>how that</i> and <i>as how</i>; as, he told <i>how that</i> he saw it
all; he told me <i>as how</i> I angered him.”</p>

<p><b>however</b>: As an adverb <i>however</i> has proper and
elegant use as, “<i>However</i> wise one may be, there are
limits to one’s knowledge.” But its use for <i>how</i> and
<i>ever</i> as, “<i>However</i> could he do it?” should be
avoided as a vulgarism; while its employment in the
sense of “at any rate; at all,” as in the example,
“He tried to keep me, but I’m going, <i>however</i>,” is
provincial and archaic.</p>

<p>As a conjunction it should not be used indiscriminately,
as it often is used, for <i>but</i> or <i>notwithstanding</i>.
Not “He was sick; not, <i>however</i>, so seriously as he
thought,” but “He was sick, <i>but</i> not so seriously,”
etc.; since the relation is sharply adversitive. “And
Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
<i>Notwithstanding</i> (not <i>but</i>) they harkened not unto
Moses”; since the preceding thought is represented
as no impediment to the succeeding one. “I have
not seen her since our quarrel; <i>however</i> (not <i>but</i>, or
<i>notwithstanding</i>), I expect to be recalled every hour”;
since the relation is one of concession and simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
transition, <i>however</i> denoting that “in whatever manner
or degree what precedes is valid, what follows
nevertheless stands firm.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>hung</b> should never be used for <i>hanged</i>. Beef is
<i>hung</i>; a murderer is <i>hanged</i>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#hang">HANG</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>hunk, to get</b>: A vulgar phrase for “to get even”
or “to retaliate upon.”</p>

<p><b>hunky</b> or <b>hunky-dory</b>: Slang terms that should
not be used for “all right”; “safe”; or “done
satisfactorily.”</p>

<p><b>hurry</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#hasten">HASTEN</a></span>.</p>




<h2>I </h2>


<p><b>I</b>, <b>and me</b>: “They had come to see <i>my sister and
I</i>” is a common error. In this sentence “they”
stands in the nominative case, and “my sister <i>and
I</i>,” being the objects of the action of the nominative
“they,” should be noun and pronoun in the objective
case. To be correct the clause should read
“my sister <i>and me</i>.” “They have come to see <i>my</i>
sister <i>and me</i>.”</p>

<p><b>ice-cream</b>, <b>ice-water</b>: Common English idioms
sometimes condemned as incorrect. The <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> recording usage recognizes the forms
<i>ice-cream</i> and <i>ice-water</i> as correct. Inasmuch as <i>iced</i>
means “made cold with ice; as <i>iced milk</i> or <i>iced tea</i>,”
it would seem that by analogy the correct phrases
should be <i>iced cream</i>, <i>iced water</i>, for one would not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
think of asking for <i>ice tea</i> or <i>ice milk</i>, but these idioms
are so firmly established that it is doubtful if they
will ever be changed.</p>

<p><b>idea</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#opinion">OPINION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>ie</b>, <b>ei</b>: The rule governing the use of these letters
in spelling is commonly expressed “I before E
except after C.” Therefore, remember <i>believe</i> is
correct, not “beleive”; <i>receive</i> and not “recieve”;
<i>brief</i>, and not “breif”; <i>reprieve</i>, not “repreive”;
<i>retrieve</i>, not “retreive.”</p>

<p><a id="if_or"></a><b>if</b>, <b>or</b>: Do not say “seldom <i>or</i> ever,” say, rather,
“seldom <i>if</i> ever,” or “seldom <i>or</i> never.”</p>

<p><b>if</b>, <b>whether</b>: Sometimes <i>if</i> is incorrectly used for
<i>whether</i>. It is used correctly when supposition or
condition is implied; <i>whether</i>, chiefly when an alternative
is suggested or presented. “If he sends
the money I shall then decide <i>whether</i> or not I will
go.”</p>

<p><b>ill</b>: The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says: The use of
<i>ill</i> and <i>sick</i> differs in the two great English-speaking
countries. <i>Ill</i> is used in both lands alike, but the
preferred sense of <i>sick</i> in England is that of “sick
at the stomach, nauseated,” while in the United
States the two words are freely interchangeable.
Still Tennyson and other good writers freely use
<i>sick</i> in the sense of <i>ill</i>. The tendency of modern
usage is to remand <i>ill</i> and <i>well</i> (referring to condition
of health) to the predicate. We say “A person who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is <i>ill</i>,” rather than “An <i>ill</i> person”; “I am <i>well</i>,”
but not “I am in a <i>well</i> state of health.” <i>Ill</i> in the
abstract sense of <i>bad</i> or <i>wicked</i> is obsolescent, or
rather practically obsolete except in poetic or local
use. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#illy">ILLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>illusion</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#delusion">DELUSION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="illy"></a>illy</b>: This word should never be used for <i>ill</i> since
ill is both an adverb and an adjective. Say, “He
behaved <i>ill</i>”; not “he behaved <i>illy</i>.” Illy is now
obsolescent.</p>

<p><b>immerge</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#emerge">EMERGE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>immigrant</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#emigrant">EMIGRANT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>imminent</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#eminent">EMINENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>immunity</b> and <b>impunity</b> are sometimes confounded.
They are both from the Latin, the former being produced
by <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in</i>, not, + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">munus</i>, service, and the latter by
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in</i> + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pœna</i>, punishment. Freedom from any burden,
or exemption from evil, duty or penalty has perhaps
not unnaturally, been associated with freedom from
punishment. A boy may insult his brother with <i>impunity</i>
but can not expect to enjoy a like <i>immunity</i>
from strangers.</p>

<p><b>impending</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#eminent">EMINENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>imperative</b>, <b>imperious</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. That which is <i>imperative</i> may
be either mandatory or authoritative; while that
which is <i>imperious</i> may be domineering or overbearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p><b>implicate</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#involve">INVOLVE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>inaugurate</b>: Phelps declares that this word in the
sense of “introduce” is improper and restricts its
meaning to “investiture in office.” But lexicographers
disregard this distinction and declare that
<i>inaugurate</i> may be correctly used to mean also “to
set in operation; to initiate; to originate; as to <i>inaugurate</i>
reforms.”</p>

<p>“<b>Indeed!</b>” “<b>Is that so?</b>” Discriminate carefully
between these terms. “<i>Indeed</i>” expresses surprise.
“<i>Is that so?</i>” like “you don’t say?” implies disbelief
and calls for the reiteration of the statement
made. As these interrogations are used chiefly to
discredit or disconcert the speaker they may be
characterized as specimens of “refined” rudeness.</p>

<p><b>indentation</b>, <b>indention</b>: An <i>indentation</i> is a notch
in an edge or border; it is also a dent; and <i>indention</i>
is a setting of type in such manner as to leave
a blank space on the left side of a margin of type-matter
as at the beginning of a paragraph.</p>

<p>The printers’ <i>indention</i> is not (as it is often said to
be) a shortened form of <i>indentation</i>, but an original
word from <i>dent</i> (<i>dint</i>), “a denting in, a depression,”
and hence is the proper word, rather than <i>indentation</i>,
to express the idea.</p>

<p><b>indices</b>: A plural form of <i>index</i>, generally and more
properly reserved for use in science and mathematics.
In other cases the plural <i>indexes</i> should be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p><b>indict</b>, <b>indite</b>: Although the pronunciation of these
words is identical their meanings, in modern practise,
differ materially. Both words are from the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in</i> + <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">dico</i>, say. The first means to prefer an indictment
(or formal written charge of crime) against.
The second means “to put into words in writing”
but it does not carry with it, the legal signification of
the preceding.</p>

<p><b>induction</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#deduction">DEDUCTION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="inferior"></a>inferior</b>: In constant and approved use in such
expressions as “an <i>inferior</i> man,” “goods of an <i>inferior</i>
sort”; corresponding to such expressions as
“a <i>superior</i> man,” “materials of <i>superior</i> quality”&mdash;all
of which may be regarded as elliptical forms of
speech. In reply to Dean Alford’s challenge of this
usage (<i>Queen’s English</i> ¶ 214, p. 82), it is enough to
say that life would be too short to admit of all
such ellipses, being supplied, even if such supply
would not make speech too prolix for common use.</p>

<p><b>inform</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#post">POST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>ingenious</b>, <b>ingenuous</b>: Words sometimes used
erroneously. <i>Ingenious</i> characterizes persons possessed
of cleverness or ability; ready, skilful, prompt,
or apt to contrive. <i>Ingenuous</i> means free from guile;
candid; open; frank.</p>

<p><b>in</b>, <b>into</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>In</i> denotes position, state, etc.; <i>into</i>, tendency,
direction, destination, etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p><b>inkslinger</b>: A vulgar term for a journalist, writer,
or literary worker, and as such one to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>innumerable</b> means “that cannot be numbered.”
Therefore, avoid such a locution as “an <i>innumerable</i>
number,” as absurd.</p>

<p><b>in our midst</b>: An undesirable and ambiguous
phrase for “among us” due to the misinterpretation
of “in the midst of us,” “in the midst of them”
(<i>Matt.</i> xviii, 20) but with some literary authority for
its use.</p>

<p><b>in so far as</b>: In this phrase the word <i>in</i> is redundant
and meaningless. Do not say, “<i>In so far as</i> I
dared, I spoke the truth.” Omit the <i>in</i>.</p>

<p><b>in spite of</b>: A phrase which some persons declare
not synonymous with <i>notwithstanding</i>, yet the <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> authorizes its use and says, “formerly
in contempt of; now, notwithstanding: used
somewhat emphatically.”</p>

<p><b><a id="intend"></a>intend</b>, <b>mean</b>: The use of <i>intend</i> for <i>mean</i>, as in
explanatory sentences, is not commonly approved although
it has the sanction of literary usage, and is
considered correct by lexicographers who in defining
the words treat them as interchangeable. When
explaining anything that has been said it is preferable
to say, “By this I <i>mean</i>,” rather than “By this I
<i>intend</i>.” Do not say “Do you <i>mean</i> to come?” when
you wish to know whether or not the person you
address <i>intends</i> to come. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#contemplate">CONTEMPLATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p><a id="in_the_street_on_the_street"></a><b>in the street</b>, <b>on the street</b>: Distinctions between
these phrases are invariably wiredrawn. Both forms
are permissible; the writer’s preference, which may
be modified according to circumstances, is for the
first. “His home is <i>in</i> Eighty-seventh street” is
preferable to “<i>on</i> Eighty-seventh street.” One
should not say “his home is <i>on</i> Bermuda,” but “<i>in</i>
Bermuda.” “He lives <i>at</i> Hamilton, <i>in</i> Queen
street.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#on">ON</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>invest</b>: Properly used only of considerable transactions,
and always with a suggestion of permanent
proprietary right. One does not <i>invest</i> (except in a
humorous sense) in a postage-stamp.</p>

<p><b>invite</b>: Used in the sense of “invitation” this
term, a colloquialism formerly in wide use, is condemned
as illiterate and bordering on vulgarity.</p>

<p><b><a id="involve"></a>involve</b> is to be distinguished from <b>implicate</b>. The
latter has a suggestion of wrong-doing or crime,
whereas the former contains no such implication.</p>

<p><b>irritate</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#aggravate">AGGRAVATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>irruption</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#eruption">ERUPTION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>I seen him</b>: Vulgar and incorrect; say “<i>I have
seen</i> him” or “I <i>saw</i> him.”</p>

<p><b><a id="Is_that_so"></a>Is that so?</b> One of a class of vulgar phrases of
which other examples are “You don’t say”; “Don’t
you know”; “You know”; “Well I never,” commonly
used but all of which should be avoided as
ill-bred and undesirable locutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p><b>is</b>, <b>are</b>: The correct use of these words depends
in a measure on the intention of the writer or speaker.
Therefore, the choice of a singular or plural verb
in cases where either form would be proper is
often influenced by the writer’s way of looking
at the subject. “The purpose and conception of
the scheme <i>is</i> to do good.” Now the mistake
with this sentence is that either “purpose and conception”
represent a single idea (in which case
they may, in combination, take a singular verb),
or they do not (in which case they require a plural
verb), and that in the former case, where the
nouns express a similarity of sentiment, one of the
words is superfluously used. “Jones and Smith <i>is</i>
solvent”: yes, as a firm, though as individuals they
<i>are</i> solvent.</p>

<p><b>it</b>: Used sometimes in such manner as to violate
the principles of grammatical and rhetorical construction,
as when referring to any one of several
words or clauses preceding, or perhaps to some idea
merely implied or hinted at in what has gone before,
as in the following: “A statute inflicting death may,
and ought to be, repealed, if <i>it</i> be in any degree expedient,
without <i>its</i> being highly so.” In this sentence
“if <i>it</i> be” should be replaced by “if <i>such repeal</i>
be,” and “<i>its</i>” should be omitted.</p>

<p>In general, personal and relative pronouns with
ambiguous reference to preceding words or clauses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
in the sentence are stumbling-blocks of inexperienced
or careless writers.</p>

<p><b>ivories</b>: A slang term used to designate the keys
of a piano; hence, the phrase, <b>tickle the ivories</b>, a
coarse way of expressing ability to play the piano.</p>




<h2>J </h2>


<p><b>jag</b>: Formerly a provincialism for “a load of
hay”; now a euphemism for “drunk”; but as such
a term to be avoided in polite society.</p>

<p><b>jar</b>: Used in the phrase “Doesn’t (or wouldn’t)
it jar you” is an erroneous use of the word <i>jar</i> in
vogue among persons addicted to using the vulgarisms
of the street. To jar is “to cause to shake as
by a shock or blow; to jolt”; <i>not</i>, to disconcert or
discompose.</p>

<p><b>jaw</b> should not be used as a synonym for “mouth”
or “talk.” Such expressions as “Hold your jaw”;
“Shut your jaw,” and “What are you jawing
about?” have no place in the vocabulary of persons
of refinement.</p>

<p><b>Jew</b>, <b>Hebrew</b>, <b>Israelite</b>: These terms are sometimes
incorrectly used as synonyms. <i>Hebrew</i> is the
ethnological and linguistic name, <i>Israelite</i> the national
name, and <i>Jew</i> the popular name of the people;
as, “The Egyptians oppressed the <i>Hebrews</i>”;
“David was the typical king of the <i>Israelites</i>”; “The
<i>Jews</i> revolted under the Maccabees.” The three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
names have their special application to the people in
the premonarchical period (<i>Hebrew</i>), in the monarchical
period (<i>Israelite</i>), and in the period subsequent
to the return from the Babylonian captivity (<i>Jew</i>).</p>

<p><b>jewels</b>, <b>jewelry</b>: Words, sometimes, but mistakenly,
used interchangeably. <i>Jewels</i> forming the stock in
trade of a jeweler are termed collectively <i>jewelry</i>; the
articles of adornment, as gems and precious stones,
worn by a lady are her <i>jewels</i>.</p>

<p><b>jiggered, to be</b>: A form of minced oath sometimes
used as an equivalent for “to be hanged”; as, “I’ll
be jiggered if I do”: an inelegant form of oath common
among Englishmen.</p>

<p><b>join issue</b>: Not to be confounded with to <b>take issue</b>.
To <i>take issue</i> means “to deny”; to <i>join issue</i>, in
strict usage, “to admit the right of denial,” but not
also “to agree in the truth of the denial.” In the
example “In their career father and son meet, <i>join
issue</i>, and pursue their nefarious occupation in conjunction,”
<i>join issue</i> is improperly used for “agree”
or “come to an agreement.” To <i>join issue</i> is properly
“to take opposite sides of a case,” etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="jollier"></a>jollier</b>: A slang term used to designate a person
who treats another (from whom he expects a favor,
or with whom he desires cordial relations) pleasantly
and good-humoredly, or in an agreeable way so as to
obtain his end. In its English sense a <i>jollier</i> is one
given to chaffing and joking at another’s expense.</p>

<p><b>josh</b>: A vulgarism for “chaff,” “hoax,” or “banter,”
which are more refined terms.</p>

<p><b>journal</b>: From the French, properly means <i>daily</i>.
Therefore to speak of a “daily <i>journal</i>” is absurd.
Say, rather, “daily <i>paper</i>.” Likewise avoid “weekly
<i>journal</i>,” “monthly <i>journal</i>,” “quarterly <i>journal</i>”
which mean weekly daily, monthly daily, quarterly
<i>daily</i>, and are forms of expression in popular use as
examples of violent catachresis. Say, rather, “daily

<p><b>key</b>, <b>quay</b>: Exercise care in the use of these words.
A <i>key</i> is that with which something is opened or disclosed;
also, a small low-lying island; a <i>quay</i> is a

<p><b>kick</b> is not used instead of “protest” by careful
speakers, notwithstanding the fact that George Eliot

<p><b>kid</b>: A common vulgarism for “child” and as such
one the use of which can not be too severely condemned.</p>

<p><b>kid on</b>: A vulgarism used in England for “humbug;
hoax; or, try to induce one to believe something
that is not true:”&mdash;<b>no kid</b>, <b>no kidding</b>: Vulgar terms
for “without any humbug.” Undesirable locutions.</p>

<p><b>killing</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#perfectly_killing">PERFECTLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>kinder</b>: For <i>kind of</i>, pronounced as one word, is
merely a low vulgarism. The same remark holds
of <b>sorter</b> similarly used for “sort of.” See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#kind_of">KIND OF</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>kindness</b>: When used in the plural is sometimes
objected to on the ground that <i>kindness</i> is an abstract
noun. “He wishes to express gratitude for many <i>kindnesses</i>.”
Nothing is commoner than the making of
abstract nouns into concrete in this way; “affinities”;
“charities”; “His tender <i>mercies</i> are over all His
works.” Besides, by “many <i>kindnesses</i>” is meant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
not “much kindness,” nor “great kindness,” but
“kindness manifested in many forms or shown on
many occasions, many acts of kindness.”</p>

<p><b><a id="kind_of"></a>kind of</b> is an American provincialism for <i>somewhat</i>
and has no literary authorization. “I am somewhat
tired” should be substituted for “I am <i>kind of</i> tired.”
Again, after <i>kind of</i> do not use the indefinite article.
“What <i>kind of</i> man” is preferable to “what <i>kind of</i>
a man.”</p>

<p><b>kind of</b>, <b>sort of</b>: Indefinite phrases used by some
lexicographers to introduce definitions; as “a <i>kind of</i>
bird”; “a <i>sort of</i> box.” If the subject treated be a
bird of some species or a box of a specific make it is
best usage to describe first what it is and then to
follow with the characteristics; as, “a bird of the
swallow family,” “a cage-like box,” etc.</p>

<h2>L </h2>


<p><b><a id="lady"></a>lady</b>: The use of this word as “a mere distinction
of sex is a sheer vulgarism.” Never say “A man and
his <i>lady</i>,” but “a man and his <i>wife</i>,” or preferably,
by name, “Mr. and Mrs. John Smith.” Where woman,
as indicative of sex, is intended, say <i>woman</i>&mdash;not
<i>lady</i> or <i>female</i>. A female is equally female,
whether person or beast. In the United States
“woman” is preferable; in England “lady” is used
chiefly when the term is not preceded by a qualifying
adjective. The word <i>woman</i> best expresses the relation
of the female sex to the human race. Some ill-informed
persons use <i>lady</i> for <i>woman</i> under the mistaken
idea that <i>woman</i> is a derogatory term; such use
is downright vulgarity. As one never hears <i>salesgentleman</i>
but salesman, therefore <i>saleslady</i> should
be avoided; say, rather, <i>saleswoman</i>.</p>

<p><b>lambaste</b> is slang and as such should not be used
as a substitute for “flog,” “whip,” or “beat.”</p>

<p><b>lassitudinous</b> is not a desirable substitute for “languid”
or “weary.”</p>

<p><b>last</b>, <b>latter</b>: The first of these words is not properly
used of only two, since it is a superlative; the second,
not properly of more than two, since it is a comparative.
Notwithstanding the fact that the use of <i>last</i> for
<i>latter</i> and of <i>latter</i> for <i>last</i> has had wide sanction, the
present tendency is toward strict construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="lay"></a>lay</b>, <b>lie</b>: In discriminating the uses of these words
the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says: <i>Lay</i>, <i>vt.</i>, “to put
down,” “to cause to lie down,” is a causal derivative
of <i>lie</i>, <i>vi.</i>, “to rest.” The principal parts of the two
verbs are:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th><i>Present.</i></th><th><i>Imperfect.</i></th><th><i>Past Participle.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td>lay, <i>vt.</i></td><td>laid</td><td>laid</td></tr>
<tr><td>lie, <i>vi.</i></td><td>lay</td><td>lain</td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>The identity of the present tense of <i>lay</i>, <i>vt.</i>, with the
imperfect tense of <i>lie</i>, <i>vi.</i>, has led to the frequent confounding
of the two in their literary usage. <i>Lay</i> (in
the present tense) being transitive, is always followed
by an object; <i>lie</i>, being intransitive, never has an object.
<i>Lay</i>, in “I <i>lay</i> upon thee no other burden,” is
the present tense of <i>lay</i>, <i>vt.</i>, having as its object <i>burden</i>;
in “I <i>lay</i> under the sycamore-tree in the cool shade,”
<i>lay</i> is the imperfect tense of <i>lie</i>, <i>vi.</i>, having no object;
<i>laid</i>, in “I <i>laid</i> the book on the table,” is the imperfect
tense of <i>lay</i>, <i>vt.</i>, having as its object <i>book</i>. The
presence or absence of an object, and the character
of the verb as transitive or intransitive, may be decided
by asking the question “<i>Lay</i> [or <i>laid</i>] <i>what?</i>”
The past participles of the two verbs (<i>laid</i> and <i>lain</i>)
are also frequently confounded. <i>Laid</i> in tense-combinations
is to be followed by a object always; <i>lain</i>,
never; as, “He has <i>laid</i> (not <i>lain</i>) the book on the
table”; “He has <i>lain</i> (not <i>laid</i>) long in the grave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The statement in present time, “The soldier <i>lays</i>
aside his knapsack and <i>lies</i> down,” becomes as
a statement of a past act; as, “The soldier <i>laid</i>
aside his knapsack and <i>lay</i> down”; “The hen has
<i>laid</i> an egg”; “The egg has <i>lain</i> (too long) in the
nest.”</p>

<p>In poetic phraseology especially, the transitive <i>lay</i>
(in all its tenses) is used reflexively as an equivalent
of <i>lie</i>, <i>lay</i>, etc., as in the following examples:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><th><i>Intransitive.</i></th><th></th><th><i>Transitive.</i></th></tr>
<tr><td><i>Pres.</i> I <i>lie</i> down</td><td>=</td><td>I <i>lay</i> me down.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Imp.</i> I <i>lay down</i></td><td>=</td><td>I <i>laid</i> me (myself) down.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Fut.</i> I will <i>lie</i> down</td><td>=</td><td>I will <i>lay</i> me (myself) down.</td></tr>
<tr><td><i>Plup.</i> I had <i>lain</i> down</td><td>=</td><td>I had <i>laid</i> me (myself) down.</td></tr>

<p><b>learn</b>, <b>teach</b>: Once <i>learn</i> was good English for
teach, and signified both the imparting as well as the
acquiring of knowledge. An example of this use may
be found in Shakespeare (<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>) and the
Book of Common Prayer, but general modern usage
restricts <i>learn</i> to the acquiring and <i>teach</i> to the imparting
of knowledge.</p>

<p><b>least</b>: Grammatical writers have reason on their
side in objecting to the use of a superlative for a comparative.
“Of two evils choose the <i>less</i>,” is better
than “choose the <i>least</i>.” A careful speaker will
observe this form. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#more">MORE</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#most">MOST</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p><b>leather</b> as a colloquialism for “thrash” should not
be used by persons accustomed to refined diction.</p>

<p><b><a id="lease"></a>lease</b> and <b>hire</b> are loosely used interchangeably.
An agent says he has property to <i>hire</i> (= <i>for</i> hire)
while the tenant says he <i>leases</i> it. Strictly, the former
leases and the latter hires.</p>

<p><b>leave</b> is used transitively and intransitively, but
critics have objected to the latter use on the ground
that the verb <i>to leave</i> is not expressive of any occupation&mdash;does
not, in fact, of itself convey any complete
idea. It is true that if you speak you can speak only
that which can be spoken, whereas if you <i>leave</i> you
may <i>leave</i> home or any one of a thousand things; but
as home (business or domestic) may be regarded as
the chief of a man’s possessions, it has been fancifully
treated as being the one all-important subject to which
unqualified leaving applies. One certainly may say
with propriety “He has just left”; “We <i>leave</i> to-morrow.”
Avoid such locutions as “Leave me
alone”; “leave her see it,” as illiterate. Use <i>let</i> instead
of leave.</p>

<p><b>left, to get</b>: A slang phrase for “to be left behind;
be beaten or outdone.” Avoid such a vulgarism as
“Did you ever get left?”</p>

<p><b>lengthen</b>, <b>lengthy</b>: The verb means to “make or
to grow longer.” Its participle <i>lengthened</i> no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
means “long” than <i>heightened</i> means “high” or
<i>strengthened</i> means “strong.” It is correct to say
“He <i>lengthened</i> the discourse, but it was still too
short”; but not to say “He quoted a <i>lengthened</i> passage
from the sermon.” In the latter illustration
<i>lengthy</i> should be used. A sermon is <i>lengthy</i> when
“unusually or unduly long” (with a suggestion of
tediousness), not when it is simply “long.”</p>

none the less undesirable variants of <i>lengthwise</i>, <i>sidewise</i>,

<p><b>let her rip</b>: Farmer, in his “Americanisms Old
and New,” says, this “most vulgar of vulgarisms” is
used to convey the idea of intensity of action. The
phrase is coarse and should not be used as a substitute
for “go ahead.”</p>

<p><b><a id="level_on_the"></a>level, on the</b>: A vulgar intensive used to emphasize
the fact that the thing stated is stated truthfully,
or that the person spoken of is, to the speaker’s
knowledge, upright and “on the square.” Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#square_on_the">SQUARE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>levy</b>, <b>levee</b>: Exercise care in the use of these words.
<i>Levy</i> is to impose and collect by force; <i>levee</i>, a morning
reception.</p>

<p><b>liable</b>, <b>likely</b>: The first of these words which is
properly used as expressive of “having a tendency”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
is improperly used in referring to a contingent event
regarded as “very probable.” Thus, though one
should not say “It is <i>liable</i> to storm,” but “<i>likely</i> to
do so,” one may say, “the building is <i>liable</i> to be
blown down by the storm.”</p>

<p><b>libel</b>, <b>slander</b>: These are not synonymous terms.
<i>Libel</i> differs from <i>slander</i> in that the latter is spoken
whereas the former is written and published.</p>

<p><b>lick</b>: An inelegant term used colloquially as a synonym
for “effort”; as, “he put in his best <i>licks</i>.”
Say, rather, “He put forth his best efforts.”</p>

<p><b>lid</b>: A slang term for cover, hat, etc., used especially
in the phrases <b>keeping the lid down</b>, <b>sitting on
the lid</b>, political colloquialisms for closing up places
of business, as pool-rooms, saloons, etc., or keeping a
political situation in control.</p>

<p><b>lie</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#lay">LAY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>lightening</b>, <b>lightning</b>: The spelling of these words
is sometimes confused. <i>Lightening</i> is to relieve “of
weight”; as, “to <i>lighten</i> a burden”; <i>lightning</i> is a
sudden flash of light due to pressure caused by atmospheric
electricity. The shorter word designates
the flash of light.</p>

<p><b><a id="like"></a>like</b>, in the adverbial sense of “in the manner of,”
as, “He speaks <i>like</i> a philosopher,” is correctly used,
but the tendency to treat this word as a conjunction
(which it is not) in substitution for <i>as</i> is altogether
wrong. Do not say “Do <i>like</i> I do”; say, rather,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
“Do <i>as</i> I do.” It is also a colloquialism, not sanctioned
by good usage, to give the word the signification
of <i>as if</i>, as “I felt <i>like</i> my final hour had come”;
and the use of the word as synonymous for <i>somewhat</i>
is a vulgarism. Say “He breathed <i>somewhat</i>
heavily”&mdash;not “heavy <i>like</i>.” When <i>like</i> is followed
by an objective case, as “Be brave <i>like</i> him,” the
preposition <i>unto</i> must be supplied by ellipsis. For
this reason as for the fact that <i>like</i> here has the force
of a conjunction, introducing the implied phrase “he
is brave,” it is better to say “Be brave <i>as</i> he is.”</p>

<p><a id="like_love"></a><b>like</b>, <b>love</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words, which are often erroneously used interchangeably.
A woman may <i>love</i> her children and <i>like</i>
fruit, but not <i>like</i> her children and <i>love</i> fruit.</p>

<p><b>likewise</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#also">ALSO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>limb</b>, <b>leg</b>: There exists an affected or prudish use of
the word <i>limb</i> instead of <i>leg</i>, when the leg is meant,
which can not be too severely censured. Such
squeamishness is absurd.</p>

<p><b>limit, the</b>: A vulgarism designating the extreme
of any condition or situation: used indiscriminately
of persons or conditions.</p>

<p><b>limited</b>: Often erroneously used for <i>small</i>, <i>scant</i>,
<i>slight</i>, and other words of like meaning; as, “He had
a <i>limited</i> (<i>slight</i>) acquaintance with Milton”; “Sold
at the <i>limited</i> (<i>low</i> or <i>reduced</i>) price of one dollar”;
“His pecuniary means were likely to remain quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
<i>limited</i>”&mdash;admissible if suggesting the reverse of unlimited
wealth, otherwise <i>small</i> or <i>narrow</i>.</p>

<p><b>lineament</b>, <b>liniment</b>: The <i>lineament</i> is the outline
or contour of a body or figure, especially the face.
<i>Liniment</i> is a medicated liquid, sometimes oily, which
is applied to the skin by rubbing as for the relief of
pain. Exercise care in spelling these words.</p>

<p><b>lip</b>: A very vulgar substitute for “impudence.”</p>

<p><b>lit</b> in the sense of <i>lighted</i> is not used by careful
speakers. Do not say “Who <i>lit</i> (but ‘who <i>lighted</i>’)
the gas?”</p>

<p><b>lit on</b>: A common error for “come across,” “met
with,” which should be discountenanced. Do not
say “I <i>lit</i> on the quotation by accident”; say, rather,
“I came across the quotation.” Nor “I <i>lit</i> on him
at the fair.” One does not <i>light</i> on people whom
one meets.</p>

<p><b>little</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#few">FEW</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="loan"></a>loan</b>, <b>lend</b>: One may raise (put an end to) a <i>loan</i>
by paying both principal and interest, and another
may <i>lend</i> money to do so. The use of <i>loan</i> as a verb,
meaning, “to grant the loan of or lend, as ships,
money, linen, provisions, etc.,” dates from the year
1200 and is accepted as good English. Some purists,
however, characterize it colloquial.</p>

<p><b>lobster</b>: A slang term used originally to designate
a British soldier, probably, in the phrase <b>boiled lobster</b>,
from his red coat: now applied indiscriminately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to gullible persons, perhaps on account of the reputed
gullibility of the British soldier.</p>

<p><b>lonely</b>, <b>solitary</b>: These two words must not be confounded,
for their meaning is not exactly the same, although
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solitarius</i> is derived from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">solus</i>, alone.
<i>Solitary</i> indicates no more than absence of life or society;
<i>lonely</i> suggests the idea of being forsaken or
isolated. A <i>solitary</i> person is not of necessity <i>lonely</i>,
even though he take a <i>solitary walk</i> in a <i>lonely</i> place.
A man is not <i>lonely</i> if he is good company to himself.</p>

<p><b>look</b>: In the intransitive sense of “seem,” this verb
should be followed by an adjective, not an adverb.
Thus, “he <i>looks</i> kind (not kindly).” It is otherwise
in the sense of “exercising the sense of sight.” Here
the adverb is used to the exclusion of the adjective.
“He <i>looks</i> kindly (not kind) upon the fallen foe.”
Actions are qualified by adverbs, but adjectives qualify
what one is or seems to be.</p>

<p><b>lot</b> or <b>lots</b>: A slipshod colloquialism for “great
many”; as, “We sold a <i>lot</i> of tickets”; “He has <i>lots</i>
of friends”; to be avoided, as are all other vague, ill-assigned
expressions, as tending to indistinctness of
thought and debasement of language. Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#heap">HEAP</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>love</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#like_love">LIKE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>lovelily</b>: To the general exclusion of this word,
<i>lovely</i> is now made to do duty both as adverb and
adjective.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p><b>lovely</b>: A valuable word in proper use, as applied
to that which is adapted and worthy to win affection;
but as a colloquialism improperly applied indiscriminately
to every form of agreeable feeling or quality.
A bonnet is <i>lovely</i>, so is a house, a statue, a friend, a
poem, a bouquet, a poodle, a visit; and it is even said
after an entertainment, “The refreshments were
<i>lovely</i>!”&mdash;all examples of careless diction.</p>

<p><b>low-priced</b>: Often confounded with <i>cheap</i>. A
thing is <i>cheap</i> when its price is low compared with its
intrinsic worth, it is <i>low-priced</i> when but little is paid
or asked for it. A <i>low-priced</i> article may be <i>dear</i>; a
<i>cheap</i> article may not be <i>low-priced</i>; as, “One horse
was <i>low-priced</i> (he paid only $50 for it), and it was
<i>dear</i> at that price; the other cost him $500, but was
<i>cheap</i> at that price.”</p>

<p><b>lurid</b> should not be used for <b>brilliant</b>. <i>Lurid</i>
means “giving a ghastly, or dull-red light, as of flames
mingled with smoke, or reflecting or made visible by
such light.”</p>

<p><b>luxuriant</b>, <b>luxurious</b>: These words are not identical
in sense. The former signifies growth, as “hair
of <i>luxuriant</i> growth”; the latter implies luxury, as
“<i>luxurious</i> ease.”</p>

<p><b><a id="mad"></a>mad</b>: Used for “angry” by the careless or the indifferent.
A colloquialism not in vogue among persons
who use refined diction. <i>Mad</i> may, however, be
used correctly to designate a condition of overmastering
emotion, intense excitement, or infatuation due to
grief, terror, or jealousy; as <i>mad</i> with grief; <i>mad</i> with
terror. Formerly used correctly as a synonym for
“angry” it is now used only colloquially in this sense.
<i>Mad</i>, in the present day, denotes a species of insanity.</p>

<p><b>main guy</b>: A vulgar phrase derived from circus cant
in which it designates the chief guy-rope as of a tent.
It is commonly used to designate the manager of an establishment,

among these words. <i>Marine</i> and <i>maritime</i>,

sea; <i>naval</i>, from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">navis</i>, a ship, signifies be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>longing
to a ship; <i>nautical</i> from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nauta</i>, a
sailor, signifies belonging to a sailor or to the sailor’s
pursuit, navigation. A <i>maritime</i> nation must be well
supplied with <i>marine</i> stores, must have a large <i>naval</i>
force and be skilled in matters <i>nautical</i>.</p>

<p><b>marry</b>: Now used correctly of both acceptance in
marriage and union in matrimony: formerly condemned

<p><b>masses</b>: The <i>masses</i>, in the sense of the common
people, the great body of the people, exclusive of the
wealthy or privileged, has so entered into popular
speech that the expression is now beyond criticism,
although exception has been taken to it, on the ground
that the subject of the mass should be specifically
named. The <i>masses</i> of what?</p>

<p><b>matinee</b> from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">matin</i>, morning, is strictly
a morning reception; and to talk of an “afternoon
<i>matinée</i>” is therefore, if not a solecism, a contradiction
in terms. Still nowadays the word is used to
mean an <i>afternoon</i> rather than a <i>morning</i> reception, or
entertainment.</p>

<p><b><a id="me"></a>me</b>: “It is <i>I</i>,” never “It is <i>me</i>.” And so with all
personal pronouns following the verb <i>to be</i> and in apposition

constantly made in such phrases as “She is better
looking than <i>me</i>,” where, if the elliptical verb were
supplied, the correct construction would readily be
seen to be “She is better looking than <i>I</i> (am).”</p>

<p><b>mean</b>: A word often erroneously used. Its generic
meaning is “common” and therefrom it has been accepted
as meaning “of humble origin, of low rank or

stingy.” In the United States it is commonly misused
as a substitute for “ill-tempered; disagreeable.”</p>

means,” it is pleonastic to write “<i>by some means or
another</i>.” For the same reason <i>some means or other</i>
may be condemned; its only excuse is that “other”
refers not to “means” but qualifies the word “procedure”
(understood). If this form of speech is desired,
the correct utterance would be <i>one mean or another</i>.</p>

<p><b>memoranda</b> should never be used as a singular. It
is the plural of <i>memorandum</i> and the distinction should
always be observed in speech or writing.</p>

<p><b>me</b> or <b>my going</b>: Erroneous combinations sometimes
used by persons careless with their diction. Do
not say “Instead of <i>me</i> (or <i>my</i>) <i>going</i> to London I
went to Bermuda”; say, rather, “Instead of going....”
Here “me” and “my” are redundant.</p>

<p><b>merely</b>: Sometimes misused for <i>simply</i>. <i>Merely</i>
implies no addition; <i>simply</i>, no admixture or complication;
<i>e. g.</i>, “The boys were there <i>merely</i> as spectators;
it is <i>simply</i> incredible that they should have
so disgraced themselves”; “It is <i>simply</i> water.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p><b>midst</b>: The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> has the following:
“In our, your, or their <i>midst</i>, in the <i>midst</i> of us,
you, or them: a form pronounced analogically irreproachable
by Fitzedward Hall, in <i>Modern English</i>
p. 50, but objected to by some authorities.” Dr.
William Mathews is one of these. In his work on
“Words: their Use and Abuse,” he asks “Would any
one say ‘In our middle?’... The possessive
pronoun can properly be used only to indicate possession
or appurtenance.”</p>

<p><b>mighty</b> used as a synonym for <i>very</i>, <i>exceedingly</i>, or
<i>extraordinarily</i> is colloquial but borders on the vulgar.
“<i>Mighty</i> fine,” “A <i>mighty</i> shame,” “<i>Mighty</i> doubtful”
are phrases to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>misspell</b>: Do not write this word <i>mispell</i>. Its
component parts are <i>mis</i> + <i>spell</i>, and it retains the
double <i>s</i>.</p>

<p><b>mistakable</b>: Although formerly correctly <i>mistakeable</i>
this word does not now retain the “e” after the
“k”&mdash;an evidence of spelling reform along lines of
least resistance due probably to phonology.</p>

<p><b>mistaken</b>: Originally <i>mistake</i> meant “to take
amiss, misconceive, or misunderstand,” and on this
account some persons claim that <i>you are mistaken</i>
means “you are misunderstood”; and that when
this observation is made it expresses precisely the reverse
of the meaning that the speaker desires to convey.
According to them to tell a man he is <i>mistaken</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that is, misunderstood, is a very different thing from
telling him that he mistakes or personally misunderstands.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> treating this word says:
The anomalous use of <i>mistaken</i> has naturally attracted
the attention of speech-reformers; we ought to mean,
“You are misapprehended or misunderstood,” they
tell us, when we say “You are <i>mistaken</i>,” and if we
mean “You are in error,” we ought to say so. But
suppose the alleged misuse of <i>mistaken</i> gives rise to
no misunderstanding whatever&mdash;that everybody, high
or low, throughout the English-speaking world, knows
what is meant when one says “You are <i>mistaken</i>”&mdash;in
that case, to let alone seems to be wisdom. The
corruption, if it be one, has the sanction not only of
universal employment, but of antiquity.</p>

<p><b>mitten</b>: An obsolete substitute for glove now revived
as a colloquialism in the phrase <b>to get the mitten</b>,
that is “to get the glove with the hand withdrawn:
said of a rejected suitor for a lady’s hand.”
An allied phrase is <b>to give the mitten to</b>. None of
these is used in polite society.</p>

<p><b>moment</b>, <b>minute</b>: These words are not exactly
synonymous. A <i>moment</i> is an infinitesimal part of
time; as, “in a <i>moment</i>, in the twinkling of an eye”
(I Cor. <span class="smcap lowercase">XV.</span> 52). A <i>minute</i> is the sixtieth part of an
hour. One does not take a <i>minute</i> to wink the eye.</p>

<p><b>monetary</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#financial">FINANCIAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p><b>moneys</b>, not <b>monies</b>, although often so (improperly)
spelt. The rule is clear. Words ending in <i>y</i> necessarily
have as their penultimate letter either a vowel
or a consonant. If a vowel the plural is formed by
adding <i>s</i>; if a consonant by changing the <i>y</i> into <i>ies</i>.
Thus, <i>boy</i>, <i>boys</i>; <i>baby</i>, <i>babies</i>.</p>

<p><b>money to burn</b>: A slang phrase used to denote possession
of ample means.</p>

<p><b><a id="more"></a>more</b>: Superlatives are often used, though improperly
in a comparison of two. “He is the <i>more</i>
promising pupil of the two”&mdash;not <i>most</i>. Certain
scrupulously careful writers, as Augustine Birrell, will
even write “the <i>more</i> part,” instead of the customary
“the <i>most</i> part”; and this usage, though possibly
pedantic, is in other respects to be commended.</p>

<p><b>more strictly correct</b>: A pleonasm. A correct
statement may for the sake of emphasis be qualified
as <i>strictly correct</i>. If “more strictly correct” is good
grammar then “most strictly correct” would be also.
Both sentences are erroneous.</p>

<p><b>more than probable</b>: That which is <i>probable</i> is
likely to happen, but that which is <i>more than probable</i>
is almost sure to happen. To object to “more
than probable,” as some persons do, one would have
to show that “probable” was absolute and incapable
of degrees of comparison, whence of course it is a
matter of common observation that some things are
highly probable, while others are barely so. That a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
lover of truth will speak the truth is highly probable,
whereas that a confirmed liar will do so is so little
probable that the probabilities are on the other side.</p>

<p><b><a id="most"></a>’most</b>: Often used colloquially but incorrectly for
“almost”; an inexcusable and unwarranted abbreviation.
Do not say “my work is <i>most</i> done”; say
rather, “... is <i>almost</i> done.” <i>Most</i> is used occasionally
and correctly for “very”&mdash;a use that some
writers condemn as incorrect but which is sanctioned
by literary usage. Shakespeare says: “So, Sir, heartily
well met, and <i>most</i> glad of your company.”&mdash;<i>Coriolanus</i>,
iv. 3.</p>

<p><b>most</b> is well used as a superlative. <i>Most</i> perfect,
thorough, intense, complete, extraordinary, are
in common use and have the support of literary
usage.</p>

<p>Frederic Johnston says: “Concerning the phrase
‘most perfect’ some question might be raised. ‘Perfect’
means, literally, ‘made through, to the end,’
‘utterly finished,’ therefore, of supreme excellence.
In that case, ‘more’ and ‘most’ perfect are meaningless.
We are to remember, however, that the literal
is not always the true meaning of a word. Thus
‘melancholy’ does not mean full of ‘black bile,’ but
‘gloomy’ for any reason. Moreover, it has of late
been pointed out by the best authorities that the true
sense of a word is not what it <i>ought</i> to mean, but what
it <i>does</i> mean, in the mouths and ears of the upper half
of the people. And there can be little doubt that
‘perfect,’ in this case, merely expresses great rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
than supreme excellence. We may even say, further,
that the word in its original sense could not be used
without a qualifying word (as ‘nearly perfect’ for
example) in a world in which nothing is utterly free
from defect. To go about saying that things are
‘nearly perfect’ would be gross pedantry.”</p>

<p><b>mought</b>: Although recorded by the dictionaries as
the imperfect of “may” and often used for <i>might</i>, the
use is one which does sufficient violence to euphony
to be characterized as undesirable.</p>

<p><b>muchly</b>: Although formerly in vogue is now obsolete
and stigmatized as slang, and as such to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>Mussulman</b>: The plural of this word is formed by
adding <i>s</i>&mdash;Mussulmans <i>not</i> Mussul<i>men</i>. Here the
word “man” is no component part of <i>Mussulman</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="mutual"></a>mutual</b>, <b>common</b>: These words are often confounded
and have been so by writers of correct English.
<i>Mutual</i> implies interchange; <i>common</i> belonging
to more than two persons. Before the middle of the
eighteenth century, <i>mutual</i> had two meanings: “joint”
or “common,” and “reciprocal.” When Dr. Samuel
Johnson published his great dictionary he gave it but
one meaning, that of <i>reciprocal</i>, and, his authority as
a scholar having grown so great, this meaning became
considered the only one which might be correctly given
to the word. “<i>Mutual</i>,” says Crabb, “supposes a
sameness in condition at the same time; <i>reciprocal</i>
supposes an alternation or succession of returns.”
Thus we properly speak of “our <i>common</i> country,
<i>mutual</i> affection, <i>reciprocal</i> obligations.” While <i>mutual</i>
applies to the acts and opinions of persons, and
therefore to what is personal, it is not applicable to
persons. Macaulay condemned the phrase “<i>mutual</i>
friend” as a low vulgarism. A “<i>common</i> friend” is
certainly more accurate but unfortunately carries with
it the disagreeable idea of inferiority, and probably
for this reason is seldom or never used. There is
authority of such prolific writers as Scott and Dickens
for “<i>mutual</i> friend,” but the rapidity with which they
wrote their books may suggest that they paid little heed
to such refinements of language as did Macaulay.
Yet centuries of English literature authorize the employment
of <i>mutual</i> in the sense of <i>joint</i> or <i>common</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
On the other hand, the very strong disapproval with
which this and like uses of <i>mutual</i> are regarded by
many writers of good taste may not unreasonably be
considered as sufficient ground for avoiding <i>mutual
friend</i> and kindred expressions. “<i>Mutual</i> friends,”
says Phelps, “would not be accurate” meaning that
two persons are friends each to the other.</p>

<p><b>my</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#me">ME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>myself</b>: An emphatic pronoun sometimes misused
for “I” or “me”; as, “The property was willed to
my wife and <i>myself</i>.” For “myself” substitute “to
me” and the sentence is correct. “Myself” is used
correctly with a reflexive verb, that is, one whose object,
expressed or implied, denotes the same person
or thing as the subject; <i>e. g.</i>, “I will control <i>myself</i>.”</p>




<h2>N </h2>


<p><a id="nasty"></a><b>nasty</b>: This word should not be applied to that
which is merely “disagreeable,” as <i>nasty</i> weather, for
strong terms should not be robbed of their significance
by being applied to conditions which could only
be referred to in such terms by exaggeration. A
pigsty is properly termed <i>nasty</i>, as there filth finds its
habitat, and an obscene book is <i>nasty</i> as morally foul.</p>

<p><b>naught</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase">OUGHT</span> under <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#aught">AUGHT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>need</b>, <b>needs</b>: As an adverb <i>need</i> is now obsolete;
<i>needs</i> means “necessarily.” Do not say “as <i>need</i> he
must,” say, rather, “as <i>needs</i> he must.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p><b>neglect</b>, <b>negligence</b>: The meanings of these words
are sometimes confused. <i>Neglect</i> is the act of failing
to perform something, as a duty or task, to leave undone;
<i>negligence</i> is the <i>habitual</i> omission of that which
should be done. <i>Negligence</i> is a trait of character
while <i>neglect</i> may result from preoccupation. Fernald
in “Synonyms, Antonyms, and Prepositions,” says:
“<i>Neglect</i> is transitive, <i>negligence</i> is intransitive; we
speak of <i>neglect</i> of his books, friends, or duties, in
which case we could not use <i>negligence</i>.”</p>

<p><b>negociate</b>, <b>negotiate</b>: The first, now obsolete, was
the spelling formerly in vogue; the second is the correct
spelling of to-day.</p>

<p><b>neither</b>, <b>either</b>: For “none” and “any one,” is not
the best usage; “That he [Shakespeare] wrote the
plays which bear his name we know; but ...
we do not know the years ... in which <i>either</i>
(correctly, <i>any one</i>) of them was first performed”;
“Peasant, yeoman, artisan, tradesman, and gentleman
could then be distinguished from one another
almost as far as they could be seen. Except in
cases of unusual audacity, <i>neither</i> (correctly, <i>no
one</i>, or <i>none</i>) presumed to wear the dress of his
betters.”</p>

<p><b>neither</b>, <b>nor</b>: In considering these words the
<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span> says: “As disjunctive correlatives,
each accompanied by a singular nominative,
often incorrectly followed by a plural verb form; as,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
‘<i>neither</i> he <i>nor</i> I <i>were</i> (correctly <i>was</i>) there.’”
<i>Neither</i>, that is, <i>not either</i>, means not the one nor the
other of two. “Through diligence he attained a position
which he <i>neither</i> aspired to <i>nor</i> coveted”&mdash;the
proper correlative to use here is <i>nor</i>.</p>

<p><b>nerve</b>: A slang term sometimes used as a substitute
for “impudence,” “over-assurance” or “independence,”
any one of which is preferable.</p>

<p><b><a id="never"></a>never</b>, <b>not</b>: While literary authority sanctions the
use of <i>never</i> for <i>not</i> in cases where a lapse of considerable
time is thought of, as, “I shall be there&mdash;<i>never</i>
fear” (for <i>do not</i> fear now, or at any time in the interim,
that I shall disappoint you), it does not justify
its use in a sentence where the time referred to is momentary
or short. The emphatic use of this adverb
in the sense of not a single one, not at all, is perfectly
good, as instanced by Coleridge&mdash;“And <i>never</i> a saint
took pity on my soul in agony.” But the usage will
not sanction an extension to things which, from their
very nature, could take place&mdash;as, say, death&mdash;but
once. Thus, do not say “Robert Fulton <i>never</i> invented
the steamboat”; say, rather, “Robert Fulton
<i>did not</i> invent the steamboat.” “Paul Jones <i>was
never</i> born in the United States” is incorrect. Say
“... <i>was not</i> born in the United States.” Do
not say “I met him to-day but he <i>never</i> mentioned
the subject.” Say, rather “... but he <i>did not</i>
mention the subject.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="never_so"></a>never so</b>: Often misused for <i>ever so</i> from which it
should be carefully discriminated. <i>Never so</i> means
“to an extent or degree beyond the actual or conceivable;
no matter how.” In common use <i>ever so</i>,
meaning no more than “very” or “exceedingly,” is
often confounded with and used for <i>never so</i>.</p>

<p><b>never mean</b>: A common slip of the tongue in such
phrases as “I <i>never mean</i> to” which is frequently
used when “I <i>mean never</i> to” is intended. Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#dont">DON’T</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>nibs</b>: A vulgar title given usually satirically, to a
person in authority; as “His <i>nibs</i> sailed to-day”: a
term to avoid.</p>

<p><b><a id="nice"></a>nice</b>: This word has undergone a peculiar transformation
in sense. Derived from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nescius</i>,
ignorant, and originally meaning “ignorant, silly
weak,” it has now come to signify “characterized by
discrimination and judgment, acute, discerning; as,
a <i>nice</i> criticism.” The word has, however, also been
used colloquially in the sense of “pleasing, jolly, or
socially agreeable; as, a <i>nice</i> girl,” and the use has
been condemned but is too well established to be
abandoned.</p>

<p><b>nicely</b> as a colloquialism for “very well”&mdash;as “He
is doing <i>nicely</i>”&mdash;should be avoided.</p>

<p><b><a id="nifty"></a>nifty</b>: A vulgarism for “stylish.”</p>

<p><b>nightly</b>, <b>nocturnal</b>: These words do not have the
same signification. The one means night by night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
the other happening at night. A man has <i>nightly</i>
sleep in which he suffers from <i>nocturnal</i> dreams.</p>

<p><b>no</b>: According to critics <i>no</i> never properly qualifies
a verb, that is, it should never be substituted for
“not.” But the practise has literary sanction.</p>

<p><b>no</b>: Often used for “any” by the illiterate. Do
not say “We didn’t see <i>no</i> flats”; say, rather, “We
did not see <i>any</i> flats.”</p>

<p><b>nobby</b>: A vulgar synonym for “having an elegant
or flashy appearance; showy; stylish”: haberdasher’s
cant. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#nifty">NIFTY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>nohow</b>: A vulgarism for “in no way” or “by no
means.” If after a negative, say “in any way,” “by
any means,” “at all.” “I don’t believe in them
<i>nohow</i>” should be “I don’t believe in them <i>in the
least</i>,” or “<i>at all</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="nominate"></a>nominate</b>: Distinguish from “denominate,” which
is now only an obsolete sense of the word. To <i>nominate</i>
is to designate or specify; as, “Is it so <i>nominated</i>
in the bond?” whereas to “denominate” is to give a
name or epithet to. Washington was <i>nominated</i> president,
but was <i>denominated</i> “Father of his country.”</p>

<p><b>nominatives</b>: The coupling of singular and plural.
What number, singular or plural, shall the verb take.
It couples two sentences&mdash;one on either side&mdash;the one
having a singular nominative and the other a plural.
As to which sentence shall be first and which second,
there is commonly but little compulsion: it is a mat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>ter
of choice. But should this choice affect the verb?&mdash;“The
wages of sin <i>is</i> death.” “Death <i>is</i> the wages
of sin.” It is merely a matter of taste in forceful diction
which nominative shall precede. Yet which is
to govern the number of the verb? “What we seek
<i>is</i> riches”; “Riches <i>are</i> what we seek”&mdash;Probably
these two forms of one idea best illustrate the better
usage, which appears to be that the verb is dependent
upon the nominative which precedes. In explanation
of the scriptural phrase, it may be stated that although
the prevailing rule with the translators of the Bible
appears to have been to use plural verbs when either
nominative was plural (that is, in all such cases), still
“Death,” being here that upon which special emphasis
is laid and to which attention is particularly drawn,
is permitted to govern the verb.</p>

<p><b>no more</b>: Often incorrectly used for “<i>any</i> more.”
Do not say “I don’t want to see you <i>no more</i>”; but
“I don’t want to see you <i>any more</i>,” or “<i>again</i>.”</p>

<p><b>none</b>: Although etymologically equivalent to <i>not</i>
(a single) <i>one</i> this word is commonly used as a singular
under a mistaken idea that it can not be used correctly
as a plural, but many writers of standard
English have used it as a plural. The <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> authorizes the use of the word both as
a singular and plural according to the meaning of the
context. Where the singular or the plural equally
expresses the sense, the plural is commonly used and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
is justified by the highest authority. “Did you buy
melons?” “There <i>were none</i> in the market.” “Did
you bring me a letter?” “There <i>was none</i> in your
box.” “<i>None</i> of the three cases <i>have</i> been received”
is correct. In illustrating this point the <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> gives the following quotation: “Mind
says one, soul says another, brain or matter says a
third, but none of these <i>are</i> right.” And says, “In
the preceding quotation the ‘are,’ altho ungrammatical,
connects ‘right’ with any one of the persons
named&mdash;not with any one of the things named. If <i>is</i>
be substituted for ‘are,’ ‘right’ may be as reasonably
connected with ‘mind,’ ‘soul,’ or ‘brain’ as with the
persons (or classes of persons) spoken of.” <i>None</i>
used with a plural verb is found repeatedly in such
English classics as the works of Bacon and Shakespeare,
as well as in the Authorized Version of the
Bible.</p>

<p><b><a id="nor"></a>nor</b>, <b>or</b>: Discriminate carefully between these words
when using them after <i>no</i> and <i>not</i>. In such a sentence
as “He has <i>no</i> cash <i>or</i> credit,” the word “credit” is
used as an alternative for “cash,” and merely, though
perhaps redundantly, to amplify the thought. But
if one says “He has <i>no</i> cash <i>nor</i> credit” the meaning
is very different, and implies he is without both,
“credit” being here considered as an additional asset.
In more involved statements the distinction may be
of great importance. “Will <i>or</i> disposition,” “power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
<i>or</i> faculty,” may be but pairs of synonyms. The locution
“will <i>nor</i> disposition” “power <i>nor</i> faculty,”
distinguishes the two members of a pair as different.</p>

<p><b>not</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#never">NEVER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>notable</b>: Discriminate carefully between the different
meanings of this word. A <i>no'table</i> event is an
event worthy of note; a <i>not'able</i> woman is one who
exercises care or skill or is prudent as in housewifery.</p>

<p><b>noted</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#notorious">NOTORIOUS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>nothing like</b>: Not to be used adverbially for <i>not
nearly</i>. Do not say “He was <i>nothing like</i> as handsome
as his brother,” but “He was <i>not nearly</i> so
handsome,” etc.</p>

<p><b>nothing to nobody</b>: An ungrammatical phrase used
for “no one’s business.” Say, rather, “not anything
to any one.”</p>

<p><b>not on your life</b>: A vulgar phrase for “not by any
means.”</p>

<p><b><a id="notorious"></a>notorious</b> is so commonly applied to that which is
unfavorably known to the general public, as a <i>notorious</i>
crime, just as <i>noted</i> is applied to that which is
favorably distinguished, as a <i>noted</i> speech, that it is
well not to confound the expressions, but to reserve
their use for their own several functions. However,
the rule is not invariably followed; for the following
expression by Spencer, on “Education” is good. “It
is <i>notorious</i> that the mind like the body, can not
assimilate beyond a certain rate.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p><b>no use</b>: Often incorrectly used for “<i>of</i> no use.”
Do not say “It’s <i>no use</i> to discuss it with you,” say,
rather, “It is <i>of no use</i> to discuss it.”</p>

<p><b>novice</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#amateur">AMATEUR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>number</b> should not be used with such words as
<i>innumerable</i> and <i>numerous</i>, which themselves contain
the idea of <i>number</i> (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">numerus</i>). Say “A <i>countless</i>
number,” not “an <i>innumerable</i> number.”</p>

<p><b>numerous</b>: Often misused for <i>many</i>. Do not say
“<i>numerous</i> cattle were in pasture”; say, rather,
“<i>Many</i> cattle were in pasture.”</p>

<p><b>nutty</b>: Used in the sense “lacking in intelligence,”
this word is a vulgarism to be avoided.</p>




<h2>O </h2>


<p><b>obnoxious</b>: Formerly this word meant “liable,
amenable, subject,” but the meaning is sometimes
forgotten in the more recently acquired sense, “odious,
hurtful.” This difference is beautifully illustrated
by a question propounded to Dean Alford&mdash;“Which
of these two is right, ‘Death is <i>obnoxious</i> to man’ or
‘Men are <i>obnoxious</i> to death?’” Death, or the idea
of death, is certainly distasteful to most men, but, this
notwithstanding, all men are subject to death.</p>

<p><b>observance</b>: Distinguish from <b>observation</b>.
Though the act of observing is signified by both, it
is, as regards <i>observance</i>, in the sense of holding sacred,
whereas, so far as <i>observation</i> is concerned it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
is in the sense of making examination or careful note.
Thus there is an <i>observance</i> of the law, but an <i>observation</i>
of the works of nature.</p>

<p><b>occupancy</b>, <b>occupation</b>: The word <i>occupancy</i> differs
only slightly from <i>occupation</i> in meaning. The
first refers rather to the state or fact of possession,
while the second carries with it an idea of the rights
or results of such <i>occupancy</i>. The right or legal fact
of <i>occupancy</i> entitles a person to <i>occupation</i> at will.
One may speak of the <i>occupancy</i> of a domain and the
<i>occupation</i>, not occupancy, of a region by troops.</p>

<p><b>occur</b>, <b>take place</b>: These terms are not always
synonymous. <i>Occurrences</i> are due to chance or accident
but things <i>take place</i> by arrangement. Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#transpire">TRANSPIRE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>of</b>: That the force of this word is not fully understood
is proved by the fact that many ministers choose
to omit it from the title of Scriptural books. Dean
Alford in referring to the habit of announcing “The
Book Genesis” instead of “The Book <i>of</i> Genesis,”
says, “This simply betrays the ignorance of the meaning
of the preposition <i>of</i>. It is used to denote authorship,
as the Book <i>of</i> Daniel; to denote subject matter,
as the first Book <i>of</i> Kings; and as a note of apposition
signifying <i>which is called</i>, as the Book <i>of</i> Genesis....
The pedant, who ignores <i>of</i> in the reading-desk
must however, to be consistent, omit it elsewhere:
I left the city London, and passed through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
County Kent, leaving realm England at town Dover.”
<i>Of</i> is also frequently misused for <i>from</i>. Nothing but
custom can justify the common form of receipt, “Received
<i>of</i>...”.</p>

<p><b>of any</b>: Sometimes used incorrectly for <i>of all</i>; as,
“This is the finest <i>of any</i> I have seen”; say, rather,
“finer <i>than any other</i>,” or “finest <i>of all</i>.”</p>

<p><b>off of</b>: The preposition <i>off</i>, when noting origin and
used in the sense of <i>from</i> is frequently followed most
ungrammatically by <i>of</i>. No well educated person
would say “I got these eggs <i>off of</i> Farmer Jones,”
nor would they “buy a steak <i>off of</i> the butcher” but
“of” or “from” him. <i>Off</i> should not be used of a
person, where <i>from</i> would suffice. You take a book
<i>from</i>, not <i>off</i>, your friend; who may take it <i>off</i> a shelf.
You do not even, in correct speech, take a contagious
disease <i>off</i> him, as though it were something visible
and tangible, and were bodily removed from his person.</p>

<p><b>official</b>: A term sometimes used incorrectly for
<b>officer</b>. An <i>official</i> is one holding public office or
performing duties of a public nature; usually he is a
subordinate officer; an <i>officer</i> is one who holds an
office <i>by election or appointment</i>, especially a civil office,
as under a government, municipality, or the like.</p>

<p><b>of the name of</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#by">BY THE NAME OF</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>older</b>, <b>oldest</b>: These terms are, according to best
usage, applied only to persons belonging to different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
families or to things, as, Lincoln was <i>older</i> than Hay;
this book is the <i>oldest</i> in the library. Compare <a href="#elder_eldest_older_oldest"><span class="smcap lowercase">ELDER</span>, <span class="smcap lowercase">ELDEST</span></a>.</p>

<p><b><a id="on"></a>on</b> is frequently used where <i>in</i> would be preferable.
Fitz-Greene Halleck once said to a friend, “Why do
people persist in saying <i>on</i> Broadway? Might they
not as well say Our Father, who art <i>on</i> Heaven?”</p>

<p><b>once in a way</b> (<b>or while</b>): A colloquialism for “now
and then,” better expressed by a single word, as <i>occasionally</i>.</p>

<p><b>one</b>: Used sometimes as in writing narrative instead
of “I,” “he,” or “a.” Bain (“Higher Eng.
Grammar”) says: “<i>One</i> should be followed by <i>one</i>
and not by <i>he</i> (nor for that matter by <i>I</i> or <i>a</i>); as,
‘What <i>one</i> sees or feels, <i>one</i> can not be sure that <i>one</i>
sees or feels.’” To begin with <i>one</i> and to continue
with any one of the substitutes suggested would not
only be incorrect but would confuse the reader.</p>

<p><b>one another</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#each_other">EACH OTHER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>one-horse</b>: A slang term for “second rate”; implying
“of inferior capacity, quality or resources.”</p>

<p><b>only</b>: This word, whose correct position depends
upon the intention of the author, is often misplaced.
The examples of the uses of <i>only</i> here given will serve
to illustrate correct usage. “<i>Only</i> his father spoke
to him”; here <i>only</i> means that of all persons who
might have spoken, but one, his father, spoke to him.
“His father <i>only</i> spoke to him” implies that his father<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
“only <i>spoke</i>” and did not scold him, which, perhaps,
he might have felt his duty called upon him to do.
“His father spoke <i>only</i> to him” means that, of all the
persons present, his father chose to speak to him alone,
but this sentence may perhaps be more lucidly expressed
“His father spoke to him <i>only</i>.”</p>

<p><b>on the level</b>. See under <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#level_on_the">LEVEL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>on the street</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#in_the_street_on_the_street">IN THE STREET</a></span>; <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#on">ON</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>onto</b>: A word meaning “upon the top of,” avoided
by purists as colloquial or vulgar. Condemned by
Phelps as a vulgarism but now gradually growing in
popularity. Inasmuch as its form is analogous to <i>into</i>,
<i>unto</i>, <i>upon</i>, all of which are sanctioned by best usage,
Phelps’s condemnation is perhaps a little premature.
The word has been objected to by some critics as redundant
or needless. “Considered as a new word
(it is in reality a revival of an old form), it conforms
to the two main neoteristic canons by which the admissibility
of new words is to be decided. (See <span class="smcap">Hall</span>,
<i>Modern English</i>, pp. 171, 173.) It obeys the analogy
of <i>in to</i> = <i>into</i>. It may also be held to supply an antecedent
blank, as may be shown by examples. It
never should be employed where <i>on</i> is sufficient; but
simple <i>on</i> after verbs of motion may be wholly ambiguous,
so that <i>on to</i>, meaning ‘to or toward and <i>on</i>,’
may become necessary to clear up the ambiguity.
‘The boy fell <i>on</i> the roof’ may mean that he fell while
<i>on</i> the roof, or that he fell, as from the chimney-top<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
or some overlooking window, <i>to</i> the roof so as to be
<i>on</i> it; but if we say ‘The boy fell <i>on to</i> the roof,’
there is no doubt that the latter is the meaning. The
canons for deciding the eligibility of new words appear
therefore to claim for <i>on to</i> the right to struggle
for continued existence and general acceptance.” So
says Dr. I. K. Funk in the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>.</p>

<p><b>O</b>, <i>Oh</i>: Although often used indiscriminately it is
generally conceded that “O” is used to express exclamation
or direct address while “oh” is used to
express the emotion of joy, pain, sorrow, or surprise.
See the examples.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

       <div class="verse">“O Mary, go and call the cattle home.”</div>

       <div class="verse">“Oh! why should the spirit of mortal be proud?”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><b><a id="open_up"></a>open up</b> is properly used to signify “explore; discover;
as, to <i>open up</i> a new country,” but not so in
the sense of “introduce; as, to <i>open up</i> a subject.”
Here the word <i>up</i> is superfluous; but in this, as in the
majority of cases where <i>open up</i> is used, it would be
better to substitute a more specific term. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#up">UP</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="opinion"></a>opinion</b> is sometimes more than an <i>impression</i>, being
a conclusion or judgment held with confidence,
though falling short of positive knowledge. The word
should therefore not be used interchangeably with
<i>idea</i>, which may be a mere conception, with or with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>out
foundation for its belief. One may have an
<i>idea</i> of enjoyment, but hold an <i>opinion</i> on the result
of a campaign.</p>

<p><b>or</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#if_or">IF</a></span>; <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#nor">NOR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>oral</b> should be differentiated from <b>verbal</b>. The former
applies to what is spoken by mouth, whereas the
latter indicates that which has been reduced to words.</p>

<p><b>orate</b>: A term to avoid when “speak, declaim, harangue,”
or a like word will express what is intended.
It may, however, be fittingly used meaning “to play
the orator, talk windily in round periods”: it meets
the canon of “supplying an antecedent blank,” and
is a legitimate word, especially in humorous or contemptuous
use.</p>

<p><b>ordinance</b>, <b>ordnance</b>: These words have no relation
in common. An <i>ordinance</i> is a regulation ordained
by some one in authority as a “municipal
<i>ordinance</i>.” <i>Ordnance</i> is artillery, especially heavy
guns, cannon of all kinds, mortars, howitzers, etc.</p>

<p><b>ornery</b>: A barbarous dialectism for “ordinary”
which can not be too severely condemned.</p>

<p><b>other</b>: This word is often improperly omitted from
general comparisons; for instance, “All men are better
than he” obviously should be “All <i>other</i> men,”
etc., as the person excepted of necessity belongs to
the class embraced by “all men.”</p>

<p><b>other</b>, <b>otherwise</b>: When these words introduce a
clause of comparison they should be followed by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
conjunction <i>than</i>, instead of which the words <i>but</i> and
<i>except</i> are often erroneously introduced. <i>Than</i> is indeed
the conjunction of simple comparison, and
should be used after adjectives in the comparative
degree. In better usage <i>else</i> is also followed by <i>than</i>,
unless the word is introduced, as frequently, without
appreciably adding effect to the sentence; as, “She
did nothing (<i>else</i>) <i>but</i> weep,” though even here the introduction
of the unnecessary word would make <i>than</i>
the preferable sequence. “He knew no <i>other</i> course
<i>than</i> this”&mdash;not <i>but</i> or <i>except</i>. “It can not operate
<i>otherwise than</i> for good”&mdash;not <i>but</i>. “No <i>quicker</i> did
he climb the rope <i>than</i> (not <i>but</i>) back he fell.”</p>

<p><b>ought</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#aught">AUGHT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>ought</b>, <b>hadn’t</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#had_ought">HAD OUGHT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>out of sight</b>: An intense vulgarism for “superb.”</p>

<p><b><a id="over_and_above"></a>over and above</b>, if redundant, is an undesirable
expression. Avoid the addition of words to a sentence
that fail to add to the sense. “<i>Over and above</i>
his debts illness had now to be provided for.” It
were better to say “In <i>addition</i> to his debts,” etc.</p>

<p><b>over</b>, <b>across</b>: <i>Over</i> is sometimes misused for
“across.” Do not say “go <i>over</i> the bridge” when
you mean <i>across</i> it.</p>

<p><b>overflowed</b>: The banks of a river may be <i>overflowed</i>;
they should never be spoken of as <i>overflown</i>. There
is no verb to <i>overfly</i>, but there is one to <i>overflow</i> the
participles of which are <i>overflowed</i>, <i>overflowing</i>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
termination&mdash;<i>flown</i> used commonly by the illiterate
is the past participle of <i>fly</i>. Although <i>flown</i> originally
meant “flooded” the word in the sense is now obsolete.</p>

<p><b>over</b>, <b>not over</b>: Opposed by some writers when used
as equivalent to <i>more than</i>, <i>not more than</i>, but defensible
as having a tinge of metaphor suggestive of overflowing
quantity or overtopping height and having the
support of literary usage.</p>

<p><b>overshoes</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#rubbers">RUBBERS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>over with</b>: Avoid as incorrect all such sentences as,
“When the game was <i>over with</i>, we enjoyed a cold
collation.” Here the word “with” is redundant.</p>

<p><b>owing</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#due_owing">DUE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="own"></a>own</b>: Some critics object to the use of this word
in the sense of <i>confess</i>, but it is sanctioned by literary
usage and dates from the seventeenth century. <b>To
own up</b>, or <b>to</b>, in the sense of “to make a full confession”
or “to admit unreservedly when challenged” is
a colloquialism.</p>




<h2>P </h2>


<p><b>pack</b>: A word sometimes misapplied especially in
speaking of a number of persons; as, “the whole <i>pack</i>.”
It is correctly used when applied to dogs or wolves,
hence, from the latter application, also to any band of
men leagued together for evil purposes; as, “a <i>pack</i> of
thieves”: sometimes, also, correctly styled a <i>gang</i>.</p>

<p><b>pain</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#pane">PANE</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="pair"></a>pair</b>: Great care should be exercised in applying
modifying adjectives to this word. Thus one may say
“a new <i>pair</i> of trousers;” “a new <i>pair</i> of scissors;”
but not “a new <i>pair</i> of shoes.” There is a distinction
in the use&mdash;“a new pair” as applied to gloves or
shoes implies exchange of one pair for another; here,
“a <i>different</i> pair” would be preferred. In general,
say, rather, “a <i>pair</i> of new shoes”; “a <i>pair</i> of new
gloves.” This word remains <i>pair</i> in the plural when
it is preceded by a number: otherwise it takes the
<i>s</i>. “Two <i>pair</i> of gloves,” but “many <i>pairs</i> of trousers.”</p>

<p><b><a id="pane"></a>pane</b>: Sometimes confused with <b>pain</b>. The first
designates “a piece, division or compartment, most
commonly a plate of window glass”; the second denotes
“a distressing or disagreeable emotion.” The
spellings of the two words should never be confused,
but occasionally are.</p>

<p><b>pants</b>: A vulgarism or tailor’s cant for <i>pantaloons</i>
meaning <i>trousers</i> which should be the word used by
preference.</p>

<p><b>paradox</b>: Commonly used incorrectly in the phrase
“a seeming paradox,”&mdash;a thing that does not exist,
a paradox being a statement that seems to be at variance
with common sense. A statement may, however,
be characterized as <i>paradoxical</i>.</p>

<p><b>paraphernalia</b>, from the Greek <i>para</i>, beyond, +
<i>phero</i>, bring, is properly applied to the personal ar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>ticles,
as jewelry, reserved to a wife over and above
her dower or marriage portion, and should not be
used in the sense of finery or regalia. Yet the application
is common but savors of grandiloquence.
The finery and regalia are not, or should not be,
“over and above,” but should be as of right or of
good taste. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#over_and_above">OVER AND ABOVE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>pare</b>, <b>pair</b>: Words the spellings of which are sometimes
confused. <i>Pare</i>, to remove the outer covering
from is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paro</i> and means “prepare”;
<i>pair</i>, designating two persons or things, is from the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">par</i>, which means “equal.” See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#pair">PAIR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>parenthesis</b>: The phrase <i>in parenthesis</i> includes
both signs, and an expression placed between these
signs is therefore said to be “in parenthesis.” <i>Parentheses</i>
refers only to two or more sets of parenthetical
expressions. Due care should be exercised in using
this word.</p>

<p><b>parson</b>: Although a good word used to designate
“the clergyman of a parish,” <i>parson</i> is often used contemptuously,
and from this use has acquired a sense
that detracts from the dignity of the office; therefore,
is one to be avoided. Do not say “Our <i>parson</i> is a
popular man”; say, rather, “Our <i>minister</i>....”</p>

<p><b>partake</b> should never be used as a synonym for
“eat” or “drink.” One may <i>partake of</i> a meal with
other persons, that is, share it with them, but one does
not partake a meal by one’s self.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p><b>partially</b> should not be used for “partly,” as, having
the meaning “with unjust favoritism” it may be misunderstood.</p>

<p><b><a id="party"></a>party</b>, <b>person</b>: Except in legal terminology, <i>person</i>
is preferable; <i>party</i> means, in general, an entertainment.
In the legal sense, <i>party</i> is a person (or body
of persons collectively) who (or which) takes a certain
specified part in a legal transaction, as “A. B.,
the party of the first part.” From this application of
the term, the word has been loosely extended to
mean <i>person</i>. Do not say “A certain <i>party</i>,” etc.,
but “A certain <i>person</i>”; party in such a connection
is a vulgarism.</p>

<p><b>pathos</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bathos">BATHOS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>patrons</b> should not be used for “customers.” A
<i>patron</i> is one who fosters a person or thing; a <i>customer</i>
is one who deals regularly at one establishment.</p>

<p><b>peach</b>: Used in the sense of “beauty,” possibly
from the delicate and downy skin of the fruit, is a
playful though undesirable expression used commonly
by young men and boys, especially in referring to
women; as, “Isn’t she a peach!” Lexicographers
do not recognize this usage of the word.</p>

<p><b>peculiarly impressive</b>: A phrase heard sometimes
for “singularly” or “strikingly impressive”; but the
word is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">peculiaris</i>, “one’s own,” and it
is in this respect that the individuality enters the case.
What belongs exclusively to a person is <i>peculiarly</i> his;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
and the sense of remarkable, as from singularity, intensity,
or exceptionality, is better expressed by the
word of this class best adapted to the case.</p>

<p><b>pecuniary</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#financial">FINANCIAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>peel</b> should not be confused with <b>peal</b>. The first
designates “rind”; the second, “ring.”</p>

<p><b>pell-mell</b>: This word etymologically implies a
crowd and confusion and is not applied to an individual.
Thus, “He rushed out <i>pell-mell</i>” should be
“He rushed out hastily and excitedly.”</p>

<p><b>penny</b>: In the plural this word is either <i>pennies</i> or
<i>pence</i>. In the one case it means a number of individual
coins; in the second case it signifies a specific
sum of money.</p>

<p><b><a id="people"></a>people</b>: Where individual persons, or a number of
such, are intended, this word should be discarded in
favor of <i>persons</i>; as, “most <i>persons</i> are of this opinion.”
People means <i>persons</i> collectively; as “<i>People</i>
say.”</p>

<p><b>per</b>: This is a Latin preposition, correctly joined
only with Latin words; as, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per centum</i>, abbreviated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per cent.</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per diem</i>; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per annum</i>. <i>Per head</i> and
<i>per person</i>, <i>per year</i>, <i>per day</i> are common commercial
locutions; use preferably the English forms <i>a</i> head,
<i>a</i> person, <i>a</i> year, <i>a</i> day. If you must use a Latin
phrase be sure you use all Latin.</p>

<p><b><a id="perfectly_killing"></a>perfectly killing</b>: An inane expression used commonly
by women for “in stylish attire,” and also,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
“intensely comic” or “absurd.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#splendid">SPLENDID</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>perform</b> does not mean <b>play</b>. One <i>performs</i> music
<i>on</i> a piano or <i>plays the</i> piano, but does not <i>perform</i>
the piano. To perform <i>on</i> the piano would rather
indicate “to strum” upon it or (if you like) <i>play upon</i>
or <i>play with</i> it than to <i>play it</i>.</p>

<p><b>perform</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#assume">ASSUME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>permit</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#allow">ALLOW</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="perpetually"></a>perpetually</b>; Distinguish from <i>continually</i>. There
is a difference between that which is done unceasingly
and that which merely takes place constantly.</p>

<p><b>person</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#party">PARTY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>personalty</b> is sometimes considered to mean articles
of personal adornment. It does not. It is a legal
term, now in contradistinction to <i>realty</i>, and includes
therefore all movables, as money; personal property
of any kind whatever, as household goods; chattels
real and personal; things movable as distinguished
from <i>realty</i> or landed property in any form.</p>

<p><b>persons</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#people">PEOPLE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>perspicacity</b>, <b>perspicuity</b>; Terms often confused.
<i>Perspicacity</i> is “acuteness, clear-sightedness or penetration”;
<i>perspicuity</i> is “clearness of expression or
style, lucidity”; and is applied to speech and writing.</p>

<p><b>persuade</b>, <b>convince</b>: That which <i>persuades</i>, leads
or attracts (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">suadeo</i>, advise), that which <i>convinces</i>,
binds (Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vinco</i>, conquer). A person when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
<i>convinced</i> that he is wrong is <i>persuaded</i>, by justice or
interest, to amend his ways.</p>

<p><b><a id="peruse"></a>peruse</b> should not be used when the simple <i>read</i> is
meant. The former implies to read with care and
attention and is almost synonymous with <i>scan</i>, which
is to examine with critical care and in detail. A person
is more likely to <i>read</i> than to <i>scan</i> or <i>peruse</i> the
Bible.</p>

<p><b>petition</b>, <b>partition</b>: Sometimes pronounced as if
they were homophones, but they are not. Exercise
care in their use. A <i>petition</i> is a request, a <i>partition</i>
is that which separates anything into distinct parts.</p>

<p><b>phenomenon</b> is the singular of <i>phenomena</i>, and the
distinction should be observed in speech. Avoid as
incorrect such locution as “A remarkable phenomena.”</p>

<p><b>piece, a</b>: A provincial vulgarism used in such
phrases as “We went along the road <i>a piece</i>”; “he
followed me <i>a piece</i>,” etc.</p>

<p><b>pike</b>: A vulgarism used as a verb for “to move
away rapidly,” and as a noun, contemptuously, for
“a shiftless class of persons.”</p>

<p><b>pillar</b>, <b>pillow</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. A <i>pillar</i> is a firm, upright, separate support;
a <i>pillow</i> is a head-rest. Note the difference in the
spellings.</p>

<p><b>pile-in</b>: Slang for “get to work.”</p>

<p><b>pipe-off</b>: A vulgarism for to “take in at a glance.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="pity"></a>pity</b>, <b>sympathy</b>: Not synonymous terms. <i>Pity</i>
awakens a feeling of grief or sorrow in one for the
distress of another; <i>sympathy</i> is a feeling kindred
with that of another for his state or condition. <i>Sympathy</i>
implies a degree of equality which <i>pity</i> does not.
We may <i>pity</i> one whom we disdain but we can not
<i>sympathize</i> with him.</p>

<p><b>place</b>: Used objectively without a preposition, or
even adverbially, a provincialism common in parts
of the United States; as, “She is always wanting <i>to
go places</i>”; “Can’t I <i>go any place</i> (correctly <i>anywhere</i>)?”
“I must <i>go some place</i> (<i>somewhere</i>)”; “I
can’t find it <i>any place</i>.” Such forms are solecisms.</p>

<p><b>place</b>, <b>plaice</b>: Homophones, so care should be exercised
in their use and spelling. A <i>place</i> is a particular
point or portion of space; a <i>plaice</i> is a fish.</p>

<p><b>plank</b>: Used usually with “down” this term is
commonly employed by persons careless of their diction
for “pay out” or “lay down”: said especially of
money, and a term to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>plead</b>, <b>pleaded</b> or <b>pled</b>, <b>pleading</b>: The spelling of
<i>pled</i> for the past is not warranted, and is a colloquialism.
Careful speakers use <i>pleaded</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="pleasure"></a>pleasure</b> is distinguished from <i>happiness</i>, although
in common conversation the terms are frequently used
as if they were synonymous. “By <i>happiness</i>,” says
Hamilton, “is meant the complement of all the <i>pleasures</i>
of which we are susceptible.” Crabb says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
“<i>Happiness</i> comprehends that aggregate of <i>pleasurable</i>
sensations which we derive from external objects”:
it is “a condition in which <i>pleasure</i> predominates
over pain or evil; a continued experience of
<i>pleasures</i> and joys.” “<i>Pleasure</i> is the accompaniment
of the moderate and suitable activity of some
organ or faculty of the mind.”</p>

<p><b>plentiful</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#bountiful">BOUNTIFUL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>plenty</b>: The colloquialism by which <i>plenty</i>, which
is a noun, is treated as an adjective or adverb
is altogether inadmissible. In such cases <i>plentiful</i>
and <i>plentifully</i> should be used. “We have <i>plenty
of</i> money.” “Cash is <i>plentiful</i>.” “We are <i>plentifully</i>
supplied”&mdash;not “We have <i>plenty</i> enough
cash.”</p>

<p><b>plunk</b>: A vulgarism for a silver dollar.</p>

<p><b>polite</b>, <b>civil</b>, <b>polished</b>: <i>Civil</i>, from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">civilis</i>,
from <i>civis</i>, a citizen, denotes that which is becoming
to a citizen. <i>Polite</i> is the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">politus</i>, participle of
<i>polio</i>, polish. Civility is therefore negative, the mere
absence of rudeness, whereas politeness is the positive
evidence of good breeding. A <i>polite</i> man is naturally
so, but a <i>polished</i> man is one who has, by art, acquired
the smoothness which comes of having had
the rough edges rubbed off. <i>Polite</i> denotes a quality;
<i>polished</i> denotes a state.</p>

<p><b>politics</b> is a singular word of plural form. “His
hobby <i>is politics</i>”&mdash;not “<i>Politics are</i> his hobby.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p><b>polity</b> and <b>policy</b> both come from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">politica</i>,
(Gr. <i>politeia</i>, polity, <i>polis</i>, city); but they must not be
confounded. “<i>Polity</i> is the permanent system of government
of a state, a church, or a society; <i>policy</i> is
the method of management with reference to the attainment
of certain ends. The national <i>polity</i> of the
United States is republican; each administration has
a <i>policy</i> of its own.”</p>

<p><b>pore</b>: Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#pour">POUR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>possessive case, the</b>: A very unnecessary difficulty
appears to be felt, even by educated men, in the use
of the apostrophe in the possessive case. It is placed
immediately after the noun under consideration. If,
for instance, you are talking of a lady and refer to
her glove, you say “the <i>lady’s</i> glove”&mdash;then the apostrophe
should immediately follow the noun in question;
viz., <i>lady</i>, in the singular. If, however, there are
two ladies or more, you say “the <i>ladies’</i> gloves,” and
the apostrophe should follow <i>ladies</i>; that is, <i>lady</i>, in
the plural. In like manner, you write “the <i>boy’s</i>
father,” or “the <i>boys’</i> father,” when referring to one
or to two or more boys, respectively. “The <i>man’s</i>
hat,” “the <i>men’s</i> hats,” with the apostrophe following
the noun <i>man</i> or <i>men</i>, will note the possessive in
the singular and plural for the noun <i>man</i>.</p>

<p>The nearest approach to a difficulty is where a
plural ends with an “s” or a sibilant sound; but here
the rule is still the same&mdash;place the apostrophe after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the noun referred to, that is, the plural, though for
the sake of smoothness and euphony, omit the succeeding
(or rather non-succeeding) “s.” Thus, “the
<i>boss’s</i> desk” in the singular, “the <i>bosses’</i> desks,” in
the plural. When the singular ends in “s,” the possessive
“s” is usually retained, excepting where the
noun has three or more syllables and the word following
commences with this letter. Thus, Charles’s
uncle; Burns’s poems; Burns’s stanza; Damocles’
sword. The possessive “s” is also generally omitted
before “sake”&mdash;as, “For conscience’ <i>sake</i>” (conscience
having the “s” sound); “for Jesus’ <i>sake</i>.”</p>

<p>In speaking of a firm, where the partners constitute
but one object of contemplation, the apostrophe
is used but once&mdash;after the complete object of contemplation,
that is, after the title or firm name; as,
“Jones and Robinson’s store.” If Jones and Robinson,
instead of being in partnership had independent
businesses you would speak of “Jones’s and Robinson’s
stores”&mdash;this being no exception to, but merely
an exemplification of, the rule that the apostrophe
immediately follows the noun or name (or firm name)
under consideration.</p>

<p>Occasionally, the possessive appears in double form,
the substantive being preceded by <i>of</i> and followed by
the apostrophe with <i>s</i>. This occurs, however, only in
idiomatic phrases, as, “He was a friend of my father’s,”
which is equivalent to “He was one of my father’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
friends” or “He was a friend of (the number of) my
father’s (friends),” when it may be supposed that the
person spoken of possesses more than one object of
the kind referred to, this double form of possessive
is properly used. “It was a fault of my friend to be
loquacious” would signify the one particular weakness
of my friend: “It was a fault of my friend’s to be
loquacious,” that is, “of my friend’s faults,” would
signify that this was one of various faults.</p>

<p>The apostrophe is not used with the possessive personal
pronouns. Write “yours (<i>not</i> your’s) truly.”
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#s">’S</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="post"></a>post</b>: A colloquialism, generally undesirable, for
<i>inform</i>. It is derived from the bookkeeping signification
of the term, where it means that the ledger is
supplied, by transfer, with the information contained
in the books of original entry.</p>

<p><b><a id="pour"></a>pour</b>, <b>pore</b>: Exercise care in using these homophones.
The first is of Celtic origin and means “to
cause to flow, as a liquid, in a continuous stream”;
whereas <i>pore</i> is from the Middle English <i>poren</i>, and
means “to gaze or ponder with close and continued
application, as in reading or studying.”</p>

<p><b>power</b>: In the sense of “a great number or quantity,”
this word is an undesirable colloquialism that
has gained ground especially in rural districts. One
may say of a man “He was a <i>power</i> among the
people,” but not “A <i>power</i> of people heard him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p><b>practical</b>: Do not confound with <b>practicable</b>. The
former means “that can be put into practise or rendered
applicable for use; as, <i>practical</i> knowledge”;
whereas the latter is perhaps best expressed by the
synonym “feasible.” <i>Practical</i> has a general application,
being governed by actual use and experience;
as, <i>practical</i> statesmanship or wisdom: <i>practicable</i>,
on the contrary, is particular, and signifies the suitability
of the particular thing named to the desired end.
Thus one may know a <i>practical</i> man but not a <i>practicable</i>
one.</p>

<p><b><a id="pray"></a>pray</b>, <b>prey</b>: Exercise care in using these homophones.
Etymologically they are distinct. <i>Pray</i> is
from Old French <i lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">praier</i>, to ask; while <i>prey</i> is from
Old French <i lang="fro" xml:lang="fro">preier</i>, booty, probably from the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prœhendo</i>, to seize. Note the difference in spelling.</p>

<p><b>precedent</b>, <b>president</b>: Although almost homophones
these terms have widely different meanings. A <i>precedent</i>
is something that has occurred before in time and
is considered as an established rule or an authorized
example; a <i>president</i> is the head of a nation, society,
or the like.</p>

<p><b>predicate</b>, <b>predict</b>: Though these words are both
derived from the same Latin source, the one must not
be used for the other. To <i>predict</i> is to foretell,
whereas to <i>predicate</i> is to proclaim as inherent. In
United States usage <i>predicate</i>, with <i>on</i> or <i>upon</i>, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
sometimes treated as synonymous with <i>establish</i>; as,
“On what do you <i>predicate</i> the assertion?”</p>

<p><b><a id="prefer"></a>prefer</b>: The act or thing preferred should never be
followed by <i>than</i>. <i>Prefer</i> is properly followed by the
preposition <i>to</i>, or occasionally by <i>above</i> or <i>before</i>.
Thus do not say “I <i>prefer</i> to talk than to dance,” but
“I <i>prefer</i> talking <i>to</i> dancing.”</p>

<p><b>preferable</b>: If the preference is stated in terms, as
“This is <i>preferable</i> to that,” the word is followed by
the preposition <i>to</i>&mdash;never by <i>than</i>. The preference
may, however, be implied; as, “This is <i>preferable</i>.”</p>

<p><b>prejudice</b>: Sometimes erroneously used for “prepossess”
or “predispose.” A <i>prepossession</i> is always
favorable, a <i>prejudice</i> always unfavorable, unless the
contrary is expressly stated. <i>Predispose</i> means “to
dispose or incline beforehand.” Therefore, we should
not say that a person is <i>prejudiced</i> in any one’s favor
but that he is <i>prepossessed</i> or <i>predisposed</i>.</p>

<p><b>preposition</b>: “The part of speech or particle that
denotes the relation of an object to an action or thing;
so called because it is usually placed before its object.”
The correct use of these little words is often
puzzling to persons of education. For the purpose
of their guidance the following partial list is given.
A comprehensive work on the subject of their correct
use is “English Synonyms, Antonyms and Prepositions,”
by Dr. James C. Fernald.</p>

<p><b>present</b> is to be distinguished from <b>introduce</b>. Introduction
takes place among equals, but a presentation
takes place by act of grace. Then the favored
person is brought into the presence of some
superior or other persons, be it lady or celebrity, who
is graciously pleased to grant the privilege, which
however does not permit the subsequent familiarity
of an introduction. A man may be <i>presented</i> at court
or to a reigning beauty, but he is merely <i>introduced</i>
to the man who may afterwards become a college
chum.</p>

<p><b><a id="pretend"></a>pretend</b> is so commonly used in a bad sense that
it becomes improper to use it (even in the sense of
claim) for <i>profess</i>; for a profession is made only of
what one is happy or proud to profess. Therefore
say, “I <i>profess</i> (not I <i>pretend</i> to) skill in surgery.”</p>

<p><b>pretty</b> as an adverb may properly be used to signify
moderately, tolerably, fairly, somewhat (extensively),
but the expression lacks elegance and definitiveness,
as is shown by the following sentence: “He is a <i>pretty</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
sick man, but is <i>pretty</i> sure to recover, being at all
times <i>pretty</i> fortunate.”</p>

<p><b>prevail</b>: In the sense of “triumph,” this word
is usually followed by the prepositions <i>over</i> or
<i>against</i>; as, “We have <i>prevailed over</i> our enemies”;
“None can <i>prevail against</i> us.” In the sense of “to
have effectual influence,” follow it with <i>on</i>, <i>upon</i> or
<i>with</i>; as, “He <i>prevailed on</i> me to go.” In the sense
“to have general vogue, currency or acceptance,” it
should be followed by <i>through</i> or <i>throughout</i>; as,
“Mohammedanism <i>prevails throughout</i> Northern
Africa.”</p>

<p><b>preventive</b> is preferable to <i>preventative</i>, which is
a corruption of the former, has been described as a
“barbarism,” and is said to stamp any one using it
as lacking in common education.</p>

<p><b>previous</b>: In higher literature, the adverbial use of
<i>previous</i> with <i>to</i>, in the sense of “prior to” is not
favored. The adverb <i>previously</i> or the expression
<i>prior to</i> is preferred.</p>

<p><b>prey</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#pray">PRAY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>principle</b>, <b>principal</b>: Exercise care in the use of
these homophones. <i>Principle</i> is a source or cause
from which a thing proceeds: <i>principal</i>, first or highest
in rank. Note the difference in spelling.</p>

<p><b>profess</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#pretend">PRETEND</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>promise</b> should never be used for “assure.” A
<i>promise</i> always implies futurity. Do not say “He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
was alarmed, I <i>promise</i> you;” say, rather, “I <i>assure</i>
you.”</p>

<p><b>pronouns in the objective</b>: Often the coupling of
one pronoun with another leads a careless speaker
into error, where had one pronoun only been used,
no doubt or difficulty would have been experienced.
“If he calls for (you and) <i>I</i>, we will go.” If the
words in parenthesis be omitted no one would think
of saying “for <i>I</i>,” but would naturally use the correct
pronoun <i>me</i>. This method of elision will generally
elucidate the correct usage. “To talk like that before
(you and) <i>I</i> was atrocious.” Say <i>me</i>, as you certainly
would if you omitted the words in parenthesis.</p>

<p><b>prophecy</b>, <b>prophesy</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. A <i>prophecy</i> is a prediction, the
foretelling of an event; to <i>prophesy</i> is to predict, or
foretell an event. Note the difference in spelling.</p>

<p><b>proposal</b>, as distinguished from <b>proposition</b>, refers
to the difference in treatment of the matter at issue.
The one invites a plain “yes” or “no,” whereas the
other suggests consideration or debate. A <i>proposal</i>
of marriage usually anticipates an immediate reply,
whereas a <i>proposition</i> for partnership involves reflection
and discussion of terms.</p>

<p><b>propose</b>, <b>purpose</b>: Words often used incorrectly.
To <i>propose</i> is to offer; to <i>purpose</i> is to intend. One
<i>proposes</i> to a young lady if one’s <i>purpose</i> is to marry
her. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#contemplate">CONTEMPLATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p><b>proven</b>: An irregular form of the past participle
of <i>prove</i> used correctly only in courts of law. The
word should be restricted to the Scotch verdict of
“not <i>proven</i>,” which signifies of a charge that it has
neither been proved nor disproved. The modern
pernicious tendency among reporters is to use <i>proven</i>
instead of <i>proved</i>.</p>

<p><b>providing</b>, <b>provided</b>: The first of these words,
which is not a conjunction, is sometimes improperly
used for <i>provided</i>, which is. Say, “You may go, <i>provided</i>
(<i>not</i> providing) the weather be fine.”</p>

<p><b>provoke</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#aggravate">AGGRAVATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>pull</b> used to designate “influence” is a vulgarism
of the street and the political arena that should be
discountenanced. “Influence” is a better word.</p>

<p><b>pupil</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#scholar">SCHOLAR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="push_the_whole"></a>push, the whole</b>: A vulgar phrase used to designate
all the persons that form a party: an Anglicism.
In English slang “push” is used for “crowd” probably
from the proverbial restlessness and crushing in
which English crowds usually indulge.</p>

<p><b>put</b>: For <i>run</i> or <i>ran</i>; as, “You ought to have seen
him <i>put</i>”; “Then he <i>put</i> (sometimes, <i>put out</i>) for
home”: an archaic usage now appearing as a colloquial
Americanism. <i>Stay put</i> in the sense of
“remain where (or as) placed” is also an Americanism,
never used (unless playfully) by correct
speakers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>




<h2>Q </h2>


<p><b>quantity</b> is properly applied to that which is measurable,
as is “number” to that which may be counted.
“A <i>quantity</i> of people”; “a <i>quantity</i> of birds,” are
both incorrect; substitute the word <i>number</i> in both
cases.</p>

<p><b>quarter of</b>: As applied to time this is incorrect.
Such an ambiguity can be avoided by substituting
<i>to</i> for <i>of</i>. For example, a quarter of seven is one and
three-fourths not a quarter <i>to</i> the hour of seven; yet
the phrase “quarter of” is often misapplied to time
by persons of average education.</p>

<p><b>quit</b> is sometimes used incorrectly for <b>cease</b>. You
may <i>quit</i> business, but do not ask your companion
to “<i>quit</i> fooling.”</p>

<p><b>quite</b>: In general <i>quite</i> means “to the fullest extent,
totally, perfectly”; colloquially, it means “very,
considerably.” It is from the French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">quitte</i>, meaning
“discharged,” being the equivalent of the English
“quits,” a word used in games to designate when the
players are even with one another. Therefore such a
phrase as “quite a number” is unjustifiable. “Number”
is indefinite in its significance just as are also
“few,” “little,” and “some.” As Richard Grant
White says, “A cup or a theater may be <i>quite</i> full;
and there may be <i>quite</i> a pint in a cup or <i>quite</i> a
thousand people in the theater; and neither may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<i>quite</i> full.” Yet Thomas Hughes, author of “Tom
Brown’s Schooldays,” wrote in a letter concerning an
intercollegiate boat-race “<i>quite</i> a number of young
Americans.” The local colloquialism “quite some”
is wholly indefensible.</p>

<p><b>quite so</b>: An undesirable locution, common in
England and to some extent in America, and used
to signify assent, which should be avoided. “He
jabbers like an idiot.” “<i>Quite so, quite so.</i>”</p>

<p><b>quite the lady</b>: A vulgarism for “very ladylike.”</p>




<h2>R </h2>


<p><b>rabbit</b>, <b>rarebit</b>: The correct form of this term is
<i>rabbit</i>. A <i>Welsh rabbit</i> is toasted or melted cheese
well-seasoned and served on toast. This term, probably
of slang origin, is analogous to <i>Munster plums</i>
designating Irish potatoes, and <i>Glasgow magistrate</i>,
designating a salt herring.</p>

<p><b>rag</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#chew_the_rag">CHEW THE RAG</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>raise</b>: As a verb this is often misapplied to the
bringing up of human beings. One <i>rears</i> cattle, <i>raises</i>
chickens, but <i>brings up</i> children. <i>Rear</i>, meaning “to
nurture and train,” may also be used of children.</p>

<p>You may <i>raise</i> a fund for rent because the rent
has been <i>raised</i>; but in speaking of this it were better
to say “has been <i>increased</i>.” The colloquial use
of <i>raise</i> for an increase in salary should also be
avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p><b>raise</b>, <b>raze</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
homophones. To <i>raise</i> is to cause to rise, elevate;
but to <i>raze</i> is to level with the ground, as a building.</p>

<p><b>rare</b>: In the United States <i>rare</i> applied to meat is
used to designate meat that is not well done; in England,
the term is used to designate meat that is not
fresh.</p>

<p><b>rarely or ever</b>: Often incorrectly used for “rarely
<i>if</i> ever”: the word <i>seldom</i> is preferable.</p>

<p><b>rather</b>: Superfluous with adjectives ending in <i>-ish</i>,
when this implies <i>rather</i>; as, “<i>rather</i> warmish,”
“<i>rather</i> coldish.” Charles Lamb jestingly made the
error apparent in closing a letter with “yours ratherish
unwell.” But with adjectives where <i>-ish</i> expresses
quality only, not degree, <i>rather</i> is admissible, and may
make a neat distinction; as, “<i>rather</i> foolish.”</p>

<p><b>rattle</b>: In the sense of “to throw suddenly into
confusion” this word is a colloquialism which has
much currency. <i>Disconcert</i> is a preferable term
though not nearly so expressive.</p>

<p><b>read</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#peruse">PERUSE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="real"></a>real</b> used for <b>very</b> is an undesirable colloquialism.
Avoid such locutions as “<i>real</i> glad”; “<i>real</i> smart”;
“<i>real</i> pleased.” <i>Very</i> is the correct word to use.</p>

<p><b>realized</b> should not be used for “obtained.”</p>

<p><b>receipt</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#recipe">RECIPE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="recipe"></a>recipe</b> refers to the thing&mdash;the <i>combined ingredients</i>&mdash;directed
to be taken, and <i>receipt</i> refers to what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
taken, <i>i. e.</i>, the identical thing prescribed. The two
words have thus come to acquire the same meaning,
though, strictly, the doctor gives the <i>recipe</i> (thing to
be taken) or formula, and the patient acknowledges
the <i>receipt</i> (of the thing given).</p>

<p><b>reciprocal</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#mutual">MUTUAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>recollect</b> is not the same as remember. You only
<i>recollect</i> after making the effort to do so; you <i>remember</i>
because you have never forgotten, therefore without
effort. You <i>remember</i> the rent is due, but <i>recollect</i> the
date of your friend’s birth.</p>

<p><b>recommend</b>: As a noun used instead of <i>recommendation</i>,
this word is a colloquialism the use of which
should be discouraged.</p>

<p><b><a id="recourse"></a>recourse</b>, <b>resource</b>: Two words often confounded.
<i>Recourse</i> means a resort to, as for help or protection;
the adoption of a means to an end. A <i>resource</i> is that
which one resorts to, as in case of need; the source
of aid or support; an expedient. In the plural, <i>resources</i>
are one’s means, funds, or property of any
kind, as distinguished from one’s <i>liabilities</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="reduce"></a>reduce</b>, <b>lessen</b>: To <i>reduce</i> is to bring to a specified
form or inferior condition; to <i>lessen</i> is to diminish.
Do not say “to <i>reduce</i> cases in which the death penalty
may be inflicted”; say, rather, “to <i>lessen</i> the number
of cases, etc.”</p>

<p><b>regardless</b> is an adjective meaning “exercising no
regard; heedless,” and should never be used as in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
the common vulgarism “got up <i>regardless</i>” which is
incomplete, and which to be correct should be rendered
“got up <i>regardless of expense</i>.”</p>

<p><b><a id="relation"></a>relation</b>, <b>relative</b>, <b>kinsman</b>: The distinction between
these words is not commonly known. A <i>relation</i>
or <i>relative</i> is one to whom another may be related
by ties of blood or by law. Thus, a brother is a <i>relation</i>
or <i>relative</i> by ties of blood; and a brother-in-law
is a <i>relation</i> or <i>relative</i> by law. A <i>kinsman</i>, as the
formation of the word shows, is a “man’s kin”; that
is, one of his own blood, as a brother or cousin.</p>

<p><b>relic</b>, <b>relict</b>; These words, though once interchangeable
are no longer so; <i>relict</i> in the sense of <i>relic</i> now
being obsolete. A <i>relic</i> is a fragment that remains
after the loss or decay of the rest. A <i>relict</i> is either
a widow or a widower. In this sense the term, common
in law, is archaic or humorous in general use.</p>

<p><b>relieve</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#alleviate">ALLEVIATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>remainder</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#balance">BALANCE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>remains</b> should not be used for “corpse” or “body.”</p>

<p><b>remit</b>: In commercial usage this word implies the
discharge of an account by payment sent; and it
should not generally be used as a synonym for <i>send</i>.
To <i>remit</i> is “to send or place back.” Thus, to forgive,
release, withdraw a demand for&mdash;any of which
actions may replace the recipient of the favor in his
former position&mdash;is properly spoken of as <i>remit</i>. It
is in this sense only that <i>remit</i> is permissible for dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>charge
of an obligation, though by payment, as this
procedure places the parties in the same state as that
in which they were before the obligation was incurred.</p>

<p><b>rendering</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#rendition">RENDITION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="rendition"></a>rendition</b>: Although this word has the meaning of
“artistic interpretation or reproduction, as of the
spirit of a composer,” the word <i>rendering</i> is preferably
employed in referring to a delineation or interpretation
in art and the drama. Describe an artistic
version or a literary translation as a <i>rendering</i>, and an
amount rendered or produced, as a yield of cocoons,
as a <i>rendition</i>. The former specially signifies the act,
the latter the thing produced by the act, though there
is of course a blending point of the two which is none
other than the whole.</p>

<p><b>replace</b>: The use of this word with the sense of “succeed”
has been subjected to criticism, usage decrees
that to <i>replace</i> is to “take or fill the place of; supersede
in any manner.” To <i>succeed</i> is to “come next
in order especially in a manner prescribed by law.”</p>

<p><b>reply</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#answer">ANSWER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>reputation</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#character">CHARACTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>requirement</b>, <b>requisite</b>, <b>requisition</b>: Whereas a
<i>requisite</i> is that which can not be dispensed with, a
<i>requirement</i> is rather that which is insisted on, if desired
conditions are to be fulfilled. Fresh air is a
<i>requisite</i> of life; the apology you ask is a hard <i>requirement</i>.
My <i>requirements</i> are few; my <i>requisites</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
but clothing, food and air. When a <i>requirement</i> partakes
of the nature of a legal or authoritative or even
popular demand, it then becomes a <i>requisition</i>; as, a
<i>requisition</i> for accounts; to be in <i>requisition</i>.</p>

<p><b>resemble</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#favor">FAVOR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>reside</b>, <b>residence</b>: Somewhat stately words, not to
be indiscriminately used for <i>live</i>, <i>house</i> or <i>home</i>. In
the legal sense, as affecting, for instance, the right to
vote, a man’s <i>residence</i> may be in a cheap lodging-house;
but commonly the word would be understood
to designate a building of some pretensions. “Where
does he <i>live</i>?” is ordinarily better than “Where does
he <i>reside</i>?” and to call a plain little cottage “my
<i>residence</i>” is a bit of petty affectation.</p>

<p><b>resource</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#recourse">RECOURSE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="respectfully"></a>respectfully</b> is often confounded by the thoughtless
with <b>respectively</b>. While the former means “in a respectful
manner” the latter signifies “singly, in the
order designated, or as singly considered.” <i>Respectively</i>
must also be distinguished from <i>severally</i>, the
meaning of which is “separately, or each for himself
or itself.” For example, “The three men <i>severally</i>
undertook to do the share of work allotted to them
<i>respectively</i>, that is, A, B, C, each promised for himself
to do work in the following proportions&mdash;A, one-sixth,
B, one-third, and C, one-half of the whole.”</p>

<p><b>restive</b>: Objection has been made to the use of this
word in the sense of <b>restless</b>, as commonly applied to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
a horse, on the ground that it formerly meant “stubborn,
balky, refusing to go.” On this subject Fitzedward
Hall (“False Philology,” p. 97) says: “The
ordinary sense of the word has always been ‘unruly,’
‘intractable,’ ‘refractory.’ Proofs are subjoined from
Lord Brooks, Dr. Featly, Fuller, Milton, Jeremy Collins,
Samuel Richardson, Burke, Coleridge, Mr. De
Quincey and Landor. As concerns a horse, however,
if he resists an attempt to keep him quiet, he shows
himself <i>restive</i>.”</p>

<p><b>reticule</b>, <b>ridicule</b>: Two words widely different in
meaning but liable to confusion when spoken hurriedly.
A <i>reticule</i> is a bag-like receptacle used by
ladies for carrying such articles as embroidery, needlework,
etc.; <i>ridicule</i> is speech or behavior intended to
convey contempt and excite laughter; wit, as of the
pen or pencil, that provokes contemptuous laughter.</p>

<p><b>reverend</b>, <b>reverent</b>: These words are sometimes confounded.
The one is objective and descriptive of the
feeling with which a person is regarded; the other is
subjective and descriptive of the feeling within a person.
In explanation of the difference. Dean Alford
offers the following instance: “Dean Swift might be
Very <i>Reverend</i> by common courtesy, but he was certainly
not very <i>reverent</i> in his conduct or in his
writings.”</p>

<p><b>Reverend</b>, abbreviated <b>Rev.</b> as a title, should, like
<i>Honorable</i> be preceded by the definite article, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
phrase being adjectival; as, “The <i>Reverend</i> Thomas
Jones”; or, if the first name is not used, “The <i>Reverend</i>
Mr. Jones”; but “<i>Rev.</i> Jones,” used widely in
the United States, is harsh if not rude. The title
or distinction of a husband is not correctly applied
to the wife. Never say The Rev. Mrs Smith or Mrs.
General Brown, etc.</p>

<p><b>reverse</b> should not be confounded with <i>converse</i>.
<i>Reverse</i> is the opposite or antithesis of something;
minus is the <i>reverse</i> of plus. The “<i>converse</i>” is “the
opposite reciprocal proposition,” reached by transposition
of the terms of the proposition, the subject
becoming predicate and the predicate subject. The
<i>converse</i> of the proposition, “If two sides of a
triangle be equal, the angles opposite to those sides
are equal,” is, “If two angles of a triangle be equal,
the sides opposite to those angles are equal.”</p>

<p><b>revolts</b>: The use of this word as a transitive verb,
although supported by high authority, is not favored.
“This <i>revolts</i> me” is far better expressed by “This
is <i>revolting to</i> me.”</p>

<p><b>ride</b>, <b>drive</b>: One <i>rides</i> in a saddle or <i>drives</i> in a
carriage; a distinction drawn by English people but
condemned as “mere pedantry without a pretense
of philological authority” by Gould (“Good English,”
p. 84). Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#drive">DRIVE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>rigged out</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#togged_out_or_up">TOGGED OUT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>right</b>: In the adverbial sense of <i>in a great degree</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
is archaic or colloquial, except in some titles, as
<i>Right</i> Reverend. Say of a thing that it is <i>utterly</i> (not
<i>right</i>) nonsensical. Again, the use of this adverb in
the sense of <i>precisely</i> and <i>without delay</i> is not approved
by many purists, who suggest that some more
suitable term be chosen. “Stand <i>right</i> there,” for
“Stand precisely where you are” or “stand just at
that spot” is not approved; so is it also with “Do this
<i>right</i> away” for “do this instantly.”</p>

<p><b>right</b> as a noun should not be used for “just cause
to expect” or the verb “deserve.” Thus, instead of
“You have a <i>right</i> to suffer” say “You deserve (or
have just cause to expect) to suffer.”</p>

<p><b>right away</b>, <b>right off</b>: Common and undesirable
colloquialisms for “at once,” “instantly.”</p>

<p><b>right back, to be</b>: An unwarranted colloquialism
for “to be here (or there) again in a moment.”</p>

<p><b>right man in the right place, the</b>: It is claimed by
some persons that it is impossible for the right man
to be in the wrong place, or the wrong man in the
right place&mdash;the result being in either case that right,
or the thing desired, would not prevail. But the reverse,
the exact thing not desired or the wrong, may
be that which ensues&mdash;Why? Possibly because the
man who was the very man to bring the transaction
to a successful issue was wrongly placed, or because
the thing desired, which could easily have been
achieved with a certain man or type of man to do it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
was attempted by a less efficient man&mdash;good perhaps
for some things but not for that particular work.
The poor fellows who rode so gallantly to death at
Balaklava were the right fellows for the work in
hand, but at that fatal moment were forced into a
wrong place. The phrase expresses a felt meaning
and is good, as is acknowledged when, in terms of
pride and satisfaction, we refer to “the man behind
the gun.”</p>

<p><b>rights and privileges</b>: To be used with discrimination.
A <i>privilege</i> is “something peculiar to one or
some as distinguished from others; a prerogative”;
so that the term is to be employed relatively. “The
<i>rights and privileges</i> of the people,” as often used absolutely
in political platforms, demagogical speeches,
and radical newspapers, is incorrect, since the people
in this sense can have no <i>privileges</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, “things peculiar
to individuals.” Milton’s use is correct when
he says “We do not mean to destroy all the people’s
<i>rights and privileges</i>,” since he is speaking of the
people relatively, as distinguished from the magistrates
and the king.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>rise</b>: Some lexicographers claim a distinction in
the pronunciation of the word <i>rise</i> as a noun and <i>rise</i>
as a verb, making the noun rhyme with “rice” and
the verb rhyme with “prize,” but common usage
sanctions only one pronunciation, that rhyming with
“prize.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p><b>roast</b>: A slang term used occasionally by journalists
and members of the theatrical profession as an
equivalent for “banter” or “ridicule,” as in a press
notice.</p>

<p><b>rooster</b>: A word often incorrectly restricted in its
meaning. This is due in a measure to usage as recorded
by lexicographers. If a <i>roost</i> is a perch upon
which fowls rest at night, then a <i>rooster</i> is <i>any</i> fowl
which perches on a roost, be it cock or hen. But the
domestic fowl is not the only bird that roosts, therefore
any bird that does so, be it what it may, is as
much a <i>rooster</i> as the male or female domestic fowl.</p>

<p><b>rope in, to</b>: A colloquialism for “to cause to participate
in” or in a bad sense “to swindle.” In the
latter sense it is used especially when the intention
is to induce a person to invest in a scheme that is
known beforehand to be of questionable worth.</p>

<p><b>rubber</b> should not be used as a synonym for
“crane”; nor <i>rubber-necking</i> for “craning the neck.”
These terms are slang which have been derived from
<i>rubber-neck</i>, a playful expression said to be current
among the children of Nova Scotia and used by them
on April 1st instead of the more common “April
fool.”</p>

<p><b>rubber-neck</b>: Slang for one who cranes his neck
so as to see things that are none of his concern.</p>

<p><b><a id="rubbers"></a>rubbers</b>: As a rule an article of clothing should not
be referred to in terms of the material of which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
consists. Overshoes, for instance, should be so styled,
and not called either <i>rubbers</i> or <i>gums</i>.</p>

<p><b><a id="rugged"></a>rugged</b>, <b>hardy</b>: Rugged in the sense of robust, as
in health, is an undesirable Americanism for it means
primarily “superficially rough, broken irregularly; as
<i>rugged</i> cliffs.” <i>Hardy</i> means inured as to toil, exposure,
or want.</p>




<h2>S </h2>


<p><b><a id="s"></a>’s</b>: “The sign or suffix of the possessive or genitive
case singular and of the same case plural when the
noun ends in <i>n</i>; as, men’s lives; children’s books;
shortened since the 17th century from Middle English
<i>-es</i>. The apostrophe now replaces the <i>e</i>. Some
words ending in a sibilant omit the <i>s</i> of the possessive
to avoid the disagreeable repetition of a hissing sound.
The rules formulated for this work are as follow: (1)
Singular monosyllabic nouns ending in a sibilant sound
(<i>s</i>, <i>x</i>, <i>ce</i>, <i>se</i>, or dental <i>ge</i>) add the apostrophe and <i>s</i>,
except when the following word begins with a sibilant
sound; as, <i>James’s</i> reign; <i>Jones’s</i> hat; a <i>fox’</i> skin.
(2) Singular dissyllabic nouns ending in a sibilant
sound add the apostrophe and <i>s</i>, unless the sibilant
is followed by another sibilant or the last syllable is
unaccented; as, <i>Porus’</i> defeat; <i>Moses’</i> face; <i>Jesus’</i>
disciples; <i>Laplace’s</i> theory; <i>Hortense’s</i> fate. (3) Singular
polysyllabic nouns ending in a sibilant sound
add the apostrophe and <i>s</i> only when a principal or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
secondary accent falls on the last syllable; as, <i>Boniface’s</i>
mistake; <i>Quackenbos’s</i> Rhetoric; <i>Orosius’s</i> History.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b><a id="same"></a>same</b>: This word should not be used, as it is in
commercial correspondence&mdash;in substitution for <i>it</i>.
If “the same” is correctly used, a noun is implied; as
“it is <i>the same</i> (referring to an illness) as he suffered
from.” However, do not say, “Tell me what you
wish, and the <i>same</i> (meaning <i>it</i>) will be attended
to.” <i>Same</i> is also often used where <i>similar</i> is the
proper word. A gale blowing to-day with a velocity
of 60 miles an hour is <i>similar</i> to, but is not
the <i>same</i> as, one that blew with a velocity of 60
miles one year ago, although it has the <i>same</i> amount
of velocity.</p>

<p><b>sameness</b>, <b>similarity</b>: Discriminate carefully between
these words. <i>Sameness</i> is the state of being
identically the same; absolute resemblance; <i>similarity</i>
is likeness or partial resemblance. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#same">SAME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sappy</b>: An undesirable colloquialism for “weakly
sentimental; silly.”</p>

<p><b>sass</b>: Vulgar term for “impertinence”; “sauciness.”</p>

<p><b>satire</b>, <b>satyr</b>: Note the difference in the spelling of
these words. A <i>satire</i> is a dramatic farce or medley;
a <i>satyr</i> is a woodland deity.</p>

<p><b>saw</b>, <b>seen</b>: In popular use, in some regions, often
carelessly and inexcusably interchanged. <i>Saw</i> is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
imperfect tense of <i>see</i> and to be used as such only;
<i>seen</i> is its past participle, and the form to be used,
with the proper auxiliaries, in the tenses formed with
the aid of the past participle. Not “I <i>seen</i> him,” but
“I <i>saw</i> him”; not “I have (or had) never <i>saw</i> it,”
but “I have (or had) never <i>seen</i> it.”</p>

<p><b>say</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#utter">UTTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>says I</b>: A vulgarism sometimes heard from even
the educated: entirely indefensible.</p>

<p><b>scan</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#peruse">PERUSE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="scarcely"></a>scarcely</b>, <b>hardly</b>: These words are not strictly synonymous.
<i>Scarcely</i> is applied to quantity, <i>hardly</i> to
degree; as, “<i>Scarcely</i> an hour has passed since we
parted”; “He is <i>hardly</i> well enough to rise.”</p>

<p><b>scared of</b> should not be used for “fearful of.” It
should be used only when positive alarm, absolute
fright is felt.</p>

<p><b><a id="scholar"></a>scholar</b>: Alliteration is probably responsible for
“Sunday-school <i>scholar</i>” for although the word originally
signified one who attends school for instruction,
it has now come to imply one who is distinguished for
the pursuit and possession of knowledge; and, as such,
it is a high-sounding title for a <i>pupil</i>, who may be a
mere beginner, and is supposedly under the close personal
supervision of a tutor.</p>

<p><b><a id="school"></a>school</b>: A term which, apart from its use designating
an educational institution, formerly also described
“a large multitude or company” but is now re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>stricted
in its application to marine animals only; as,
“a <i>school</i> of whales.”</p>

<p><b>scrap</b>: A vulgarism for “fight” or “quarrel.”</p>

<p><b>screw loose, to have a</b>: A slang phrase used sometimes
as a substitute for “to be irrational or mentally
weak.”</p>

<p><b>sealing</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#ceiling">CEILING</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>search me</b>: A colloquialism used usually as a noncommital
reply to an interrogatory and best rendered
by a decisive answer as, “I don’t know.”</p>

<p><b><a id="seasonable"></a>seasonable</b>, <b>timely</b>: These terms are not synonymous.
That which is <i>seasonable</i> is in harmony or
keeping with the season or occasion; that which is
<i>timely</i> is in good time. A thing may be timely in
appearance that is not seasonable.</p>

<p><b><a id="see"></a>see</b>, <b>witness</b>: These words are not synonymous.
<i>See</i> is used of things, <i>witness</i> of events. Thus, we
may <i>see</i> soldiers, but <i>witness</i> a review; <i>see</i> a man, but
<i>witness</i> an assault.</p>

<p><b>seem</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#appear">APPEAR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>seldom or ever</b>: A very common error for “seldom
<i>if</i> ever.” One may say “I <i>seldom if ever</i> speak
so,” meaning to imply doubt; thus, “I <i>seldom</i> speak
so <i>if</i> indeed I <i>ever</i> do.” An alternative form is
“I <i>seldom or never</i> speak so,” which is more emphatic
and implies personal opinion, as “I speak so
very <i>seldom or</i> (according to my belief) probably
<i>never</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p><b>semi-occasionally</b>: A meaningless expression for
“once in a while” which is decidedly preferable.</p>

<p><b>sensation</b> should not be used for “noteworthy
event.”</p>

<p><b>sensual</b>, <b>sensuous</b>: These are not synonymous
terms. A <i>sensual</i> man is one who is given to the inordinate
indulgence of his animal appetites; a <i>sensuous</i>
one is one who has a warm appreciation for
the beautiful and is keenly alive to sense-affecting
influences.</p>

<p><b>separate</b>: One of a class of words which are persistently
misspelled. Note that it contains only two
“e’s”, one in its first syllable and one in its last; and
that “a” forms its second syllable.</p>

<p><b>serial</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#cereal">CEREAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>session</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#cession">CESSION</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>set</b>, <b>sit</b>: According to strict grammatical rule, <i>sit</i>
when referring to posture is always an active intransitive,
and <i>set</i> an active transitive. “To <i>sit</i> on eggs”
has been characterized as colloquial English, but is
sanctioned by the translators of the King James version
of the Bible. “As the partridge <i>sitteth</i> on eggs
and hatcheth them not” (Jer. xvii. 11). Shakespeare
wrote “Birds <i>sit</i> brooding in the snow” (<i>L. L. L.</i> act v.
sc. 2). On a poultry-farm the farmhand <i>sets</i> the hen
but the hen <i>sits</i>.</p>

<p><b>settle</b>: Do not speak of <i>settling</i> a bill unless there
is some matter in dispute concerning it that requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
settlement. Under ordinary circumstances you <i>pay</i>
an undisputed account.</p>

<p><b>severally</b>. See <i>respectively</i> under <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#respectfully">RESPECTFULLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sewage</b>, <b>sewerage</b>: These words are often confounded.
<i>Sewage</i> is the waste matter which is carried
off through drains and sewers; <i>sewerage</i> is the system
of piping and draining by means of which the sewage
is carried off.</p>

<p><b>shakes, no great</b>: An undesirable colloquialism
for “not much good,” “of no great importance.”</p>

<p><b>shall</b>, <b>will</b>: “Often erroneously interchanged. In
general simple futurity is expressed by <i>shall</i> in the
first person and <i>will</i> in the second and third, while
determination is expressed by <i>will</i> in the first and
<i>shall</i> in the second and third. In interrogations in
the second and third persons the usage is not so
simple, the speaker often putting himself in the
place of the one spoken to or spoken of, and using
<i>shall</i> or <i>will</i>, as if for the first person.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>Sheeny</b>: An offensive appellative for a Jew used
only by the illiterate and vulgar.</p>

<p><b>shire</b>: As this word means <i>county</i>, do not say
“county” when speaking of any “shire.” “Oxfordshire”
and “the county of Oxford,” are correct, but
not “the county of Oxfordshire.”</p>

<p><b>shoal</b>: In general this word is applied to an assemblage,
a multitude or a throng, but, specifically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
it designates a number of fish that move together; as,
“a <i>shoal</i> of porpoises.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#school">SCHOOL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>should seem</b>, <b>would seem</b>: Terms used chiefly to
soften requests, orders or directions. The use of
<i>should</i> in such a remark as “It <i>should seem</i> so”&mdash;implying
that something suggested was correct&mdash;dates
from pre-Elizabethan time. Here <i>would</i> should
be substituted for <i>should</i>.</p>

<p><b>should</b>, <b>would</b>: These words follow in the main the
usage of <i>shall</i> and <i>will</i>, but with certain modifications
required by their common use in dependent sentences.
In general, in indirect quotation, <i>should</i> is to be used
after a historical tense where the speaker quoted employed
<i>shall</i>, and <i>would</i> where the speaker quoted
<i>will</i>. Thus:</p>

<p>
{ <b>Direct quotation</b>: “He said to me,’You <i>shall</i> go.’”<br />
{ <b>Indirect   „</b>      “He said that I <i>should</i> go.”<br />
<br />
{ <b>Direct     „</b>      “He said to me, ‘<i>Will</i> you go?’”<br />
{ <b>Indirect   „</b>      “He asked me if I <i>would</i> go.”<br />
</p>

<p>The mixture of direct and indirect is always wrong;
avoid, “He asked me <i>would</i> I go.”</p>

<p><b>shut up</b>: A coarse expression often too commonly
used instead of “keep quiet.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#forget_it">FORGET IT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sideways</b> should not be used for <b>sidewise</b>.</p>

<p><b>siege</b>, <b>seige</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. A <i>siege</i> is an investment as of a city by military
forces; as, “the <i>siege</i> of Paris”; a <i>seige</i> is a flock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
of birds; as, “a <i>seige</i> of cranes.” Note especially the
orthography of these words.</p>

<p><b>sieve</b>, <b>seive</b>: Homophones of widely different meaning.
A <i>sieve</i> is a utensil for sifting; a <i>seive</i> is a rush
or rush-wick.</p>

<p><b>sight</b>: As a colloquialism meaning a very great
quantity, number, or amount; as, “a <i>sight</i> of people,”
the noun is to be avoided, as in the still more objectionable
expression, “powerful <i>sight</i>,” in which the
adjective is altogether misapplied.</p>

<p><b>similar</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#same">SAME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sin</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#crime">CRIME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="since"></a>since</b>, <b>ago</b>: <i>Since</i> is used generally to imply
time only recently lapsed; <i>ago</i>, to imply time long
past. “How long <i>since</i> did he call?” “Nelson
fought Trafalgar a century <i>ago</i>.”</p>

<p><b>siree</b>; <b>sirree Bob</b>: Vulgar and silly intensives of
affirmation.</p>

<p><b>site</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#cite">CITE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>skidoo</b>: Recent slang for “get out” which is to be
preferred.</p>

<p><b>skin, to</b>: A vulgarism for “to deprive by extortion
or trickery; get the better of,” either of which is
preferable.</p>

<p><b>skunk</b>: As applied to a person of mean disposition
or of objectionable character the term is to be condemned
as unsuited to polite society no matter how
fittingly it may apply to the individual designated by it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p><b>slob</b>: A vulgar equivalent for “a careless, negligent
and incompetent person,” and as such one to
be avoided.</p>

<p><b>so</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#such">SUCH</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>soap</b>: A vulgar euphemism for “wealth”; used
usually interrogatively as, “How’s he off for soap?”
A vulgarism for “How rich is he?” which is to be
preferred.</p>

<p><b>so far as</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#as_far_as">AS FAR AS</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="sojourn"></a>sojourn</b>: This term formerly obsolete has recently
been revived as meaning to “have a residence, definite
though temporary, in some place that is not one’s
home.” <i>Sojourn</i> is better than <i>stop</i>, which may imply
merely cessation of motion and does not express even
temporary residence; more specific than <i>stay</i>, which
may apply to a delay of an hour between trains or the
passing of a night.</p>

<p><b>some</b>: This word should never be used for “somewhat.”
In such sense, <i>some</i> is dialectal and provincial.
Do not say “He has grown <i>some</i>” but “grown
<i>somewhat</i>,” that is “in <i>some</i> degree” or “to <i>some</i> extent.”
“Is he better?” “Yes, <i>some</i>:” avoid such
a locution.</p>

<p><b>sorry</b>, <b>grieved</b>: Distinguish between these words in

<p><b><a id="sparrow_grass"></a>sparrow grass</b> sometimes abbreviated <b>grass</b> are
common corruptions in domestic use for <i>asparagus</i>.
There is no excuse but lack of education or lack of
intelligence and courage to use the right word when

<p><b>speciality</b>, <b>specialty</b>: These words should not be
confounded. The distinction between them is clearly
illustrated by the editor of the <span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary</span>
as follows: “<i>Speciality</i> is the state or quality of
being special; <i>specialty</i> is an employment to which
one is specially devoted, an article in which one specially
deals, or the like.”</p>

<p><b>spectator</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#audience">AUDIENCE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>spell</b> should not be used for “period of time.” Do
not say “I shall stay a spell” if you mean you will
“remain <i>a little while</i>,” the latter is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b><a id="splendid"></a>splendid</b>: Often used indiscriminately and inanely
especially by women; as in the expression “perfectly
<i>splendid</i>,” to express very great excellence. <i>Splendid</i>
means imposing; as, “a <i>splendid</i> woman”; shedding
brilliant light or shining brightly; as, “a <i>splendid</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
sun”; “a <i>splendid</i> diamond.” A heroic deed may
be called <i>splendid</i> but a good story hardly so.</p>

<p><a id="split_or_cleft_infinitive"></a><b>split</b> or <b>cleft infinitive</b>: A form of expression in
which the sign of the infinitive “to” and its verb are
separated by some intervening word, usually an adverb,
as in the phrase, “to quickly return”: severely
condemned by purists.</p>

<p><b>spondulix</b>: Vulgarism for “money,” now passing
out of use.</p>

<p><b>spoonfuls</b>, <b>spoons full</b>: These words have distinctive
meanings. <i>Spoonfuls</i> means <i>one spoon</i> filled repeatedly;
<i>spoons full</i> means <i>several spoons</i> filled
once. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#ful">-FUL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>spout, up the</b>: A vulgarism for “with the pawnbroker,”
or “out of sight.”</p>

<p><b>spree, to go on a</b>: Formerly this phrase designated
indulgence in boisterous frolic and excess of
drink: latterly the term has been used to denote
“going on an outing for the day.”</p>

<p><b><a id="square_on_the"></a>square, on the</b>: A colloquialism for “with fair intention
or with reputation for fair dealing; honest.”</p>

<p><b>stake</b>, <b>steak</b>: Exercise care in the use of these
homophones. A <i>stake</i> is a <i>stick</i> or post, as of wood;
a <i>steak</i> is a slice of meat. Note the difference in
spelling.</p>

<p><b>standpoint</b> should not be used for “point of view.”</p>

<p><b>stationary</b>, <b>stationery</b>: Exercise care in the use of
these words. <i>Stationary</i> is remaining in one place or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
position; <i>stationery</i>, writing-materials in general.
These words are pronounced alike.</p>

<p><b>statue</b>, <b>statute</b>: These words are sometimes confounded;
a <i>statue</i> is a plastic representation of a human
or animal figure as in marble or bronze. A <i>statute</i> is
a properly authenticated legislative enactment, especially
one passed by a body of representatives.</p>

<p><b>stay</b> and <b>stop</b>: <i>Stay</i> is sometimes used incorrectly
for <i>stop</i>; do not say “I shall <i>stay</i> in Paris on my way
to Berlin,” but “I shall <i>stop</i> in Paris” etc. Do not
say “How long will you <i>stop</i> there?” but “How long
will you <i>stay</i>?” etc. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#sojourn">SOJOURN</a></span> and <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#stop">STOP</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>stiff</b> is used for a “corpse” only by the very lowest
type of humanity.</p>

<p><b>stile</b>, <b>style</b>: Exercise care in spelling these words.
A <i>stile</i> is a step or series of steps on each side of a
fence or wall, to aid in surmounting it; <i>style</i> is fashion.</p>

<p><b>stimulant</b>, <b>stimulus</b>: The first of these words denotes
that which stimulates the system, as coffee does
the action of the heart. A <i>stimulus</i> is that which impels
or urges on; as, “a <i>stimulus</i> to hard work is offered
by the pecuniary reward it yields.”</p>

<p><b>stinker</b>: A coarse term applied to an undesirable
acquaintance only by the vulgar. It is a term that
unfortunately has some vogue in commercial life.</p>

<p><b><a id="stop"></a>stop</b>: The word is frequently misused, both for
<i>step</i> and <i>stay</i>. “<i>Stop</i> in next time you pass” or “<i>stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
off</i> on your way down by car” are colloquial but objectionable
expressions. The latter clearly means
“<i>step off</i> and call in” and would be met by a simple
“call in.” <i>Stop</i> implies finality, and should therefore
never be used in the sense of a temporary <i>stay</i>. The
true meaning of the word <i>stop</i> was well understood by
the man who did not invite his professed friend to
visit him: “If you come at any time within ten miles
of my house, just <i>stop</i>.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mathews</span>, <i>Words, Their
Use and Abuse</i>, ch. xiv. p. 359.</p>

<p><b>straight</b>, <b>strait</b>: Exercise care in spelling these
words. That which is <i>straight</i> lies evenly between any
two of its points or passes from one point to another by
direct course; not curved. A <i>strait</i> is a narrow channel
connecting two seas. In the plural, <i>strait</i> denotes a
difficult or restricted condition; distress or perplexity.</p>

<p><b>street</b>: According to law, land includes all above
and all below. Thus a house on the land or a gold
mine beneath is covered by the word land, and its
possessor is entitled to both one and the other. In
the same way a <i>street</i> includes the houses there built;
and it is therefore not strictly correct to speak of a
certain house as being <i>on</i> a certain street: it is <i>in</i> the
street and is part of it. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#on">ON</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>stricken</b>: As a past participle of <i>strike</i>, archaic
in England, except when there is an implication in it
of misfortune; as, “He was <i>stricken</i> with paralysis.”
In the United States <i>stricken</i>, in general application,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
is not so distinctly archaic, and its use in reference to
the erasure of words is very frequent; as, “It is ordered
that the words objected to be <i>stricken</i> out.” In
the best literary usage of both countries <i>struck</i> is preferred
to <i>stricken</i> when no implication of misfortune
is conveyed in it. <i>Stricken</i> is the appropriate participial
adjective; as, “a <i>stricken</i> man”; “a <i>stricken</i>
deer.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Standard Dictionary.</span></p>

<p><b>string, to get on a</b>: A harmless but inelegant equivalent
for “to hoax,” which is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b>subtile</b>, <b>subtle</b>: “<i>Subtile</i> and <i>subtle</i> have been constantly
used as interchangeable by good writers but
there seems to be a present tendency to distinguish
them by making <i>subtile</i> an attribute of things and
<i>subtle</i> a characteristic of mind.” A penetrating perfume
is described as <i>subtile</i>, whereas a wily sage’s
predominating characteristic is <i>subtlety</i>.</p>

<p><b>succeed</b> should <i>not</i> be used now in the archaic sense
of “to make successful, promote”; as, “to <i>succeed</i>
an enterprise.”</p>

<p><b>succeed himself</b>: An absurd phrase. A person
who takes the place of a predecessor <i>succeeds</i> him;
one who has occupied a public office for a term prescribed
by law and is reelected to that office <i>succeeds</i>
his own previous term of office but <i>not</i> himself.</p>

<p><b><a id="such"></a>such</b>: This word is often erroneously used for “so.”
Do not say “I never saw <i>such</i> a high building”; say,
rather, “... <i>so</i> high, a building.”</p>

<p><b>sucker</b> for “sponger” or “parasite” is slang of
the lowest type and should be avoided by all persons

<p><b>summons</b>: You <i>summon</i> a person to court upon a
<i>summons</i>. There is properly no such verb as <i>summons</i>,
the colloquial use of the term being altogether
unjustifiable.</p>

<p><b>superior</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#inferior">INFERIOR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sure</b>: Often misused for “surely” in the sense of
“certainly.” Do not say “<i>Sure</i> I’m going”; say,
rather, “I’m <i>surely</i> going.”</p>

<p><b>surprise</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#astonish">ASTONISH</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>sympathize with</b>, <b>sympathy for</b>: The verb <i>sympathize</i>
takes only <i>with</i>; the noun <i>sympathy</i> in its
secondary sense of “commiseration,” is often properly
followed by <i>for</i>. We have sympathy <i>with</i> one’s aspirations,
<i>for</i> his distress; the sound man has sympathy
<i>for</i> the wounded; the wounded man has sympathy
<i>with</i> his fellow sufferers.</p>

<p><b>take up school</b>: An objectionable local Americanism
for <i>begin school</i>: used also intransitively; as,
“School <i>took up</i> at 9 o’clock”: avoid this.</p>

<p><b>talent</b> should not be used for “talents” or “ability.”</p>

<p><b>talented</b>: Inasmuch as adjectives of the participial
form are justified by strict grammarians only if derived
from an existing verb, this word has been caviled
at by Coleridge (who denounced it as “that vile
and barbarous vocable”) and many literary pedants.
Burke, Hazlitt, Lamb, De Quincey, Macaulay and
Newman have however, spoken of “a <i>talented</i> man”;
and in the face of this array of learning and authority
we can raise but a modest protest in favor of the
contention of the grammarians. Such formations
are, however, not to be indiscriminately recommended.</p>

<p><b>talk, back</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#back_talk">BACK TALK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>tasty</b> in the sense of <b>tasteful</b> is without authority
and is considered an illiterate use. A person or his
work may be <i>tasteful</i>, but his food, however savory,
can be no more than <i>tasty</i>.</p>

<p><b>team</b>: Strictly a <i>team</i> consists of two or more
beasts of burden harnessed together, but in the United
States the word is extended to cover “team and
accessories,” the latter being the harness or equip<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>ment,
together with the vehicle to which the animals
are attached.</p>

<p><b>tell on</b>: A common expression with children used
in the sense of “to inform against a person,” is derived
from Biblical use (<span class="smcap lowercase">I</span> <i>Sam.</i> xxvii. 11). The
phrase lost to literary English has now no equivalent.</p>

<p><b><a id="temper"></a>temper</b>, <b>anger</b>, <b>wrath</b>: Words in the use of which
discrimination should be used. <i>Temper</i> is disposition
or constitution of the mind, especially in relation to
the affections or the passions; <i>anger</i> is violence or
vindicated passion aroused by real or imaginary insult
or injury. One may have an irritable <i>temper</i>
without being necessarily angry. <i>Wrath</i> is deep, determined,
and lasting anger, usually accompanied by
outward expression of displeasure. <i>Anger</i> may be
only inward feeling without the outward expression
of passion.</p>

<p><b>tender</b> should not be used for “give.” You <i>tender</i>
a payment; <i>give</i> a reception.</p>

<p><b>testimony</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#evidence">EVIDENCE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>than</b> as a conjunction should be used only in the
case of direct comparison; as, “I esteem this more
<i>than</i> that.” When the comparison is merely implied,
or covered by the verb, as by the verb <i>prefer</i>,
<i>than</i> should not be used. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#prefer">PREFER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>thanks</b> has been condemned as an undignified colloquialism
bordering on incivility; but what serious
objection is there to this pithy acknowledgment of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
obligation or gratitude? It has been said that Shakespeare
made use of the expression no fewer than fifty-five
times, and that the Bible four times contains the
utterance “thanks be to God,” Shakespeare’s use
of the word with “much” as an adjective is indeed
most forcible&mdash;“for this relief <i>much thanks</i>.”</p>

<p><b>than me</b> should never be used for <i>than I</i>. Say,
“He is taller than I”; not “He is taller <i>than me</i>.”</p>

<p><b>than whom</b>: A phrase objected to by some grammatical
critics, in such locutions as “Cromwell, <i>than
whom</i> no man was better skilled in artifice”; but
shown to be “a quite classic expression.” Formerly
<i>than</i> was often but not always used as a preposition,
and <i>than whom</i> is probably a survival of such usage.
“<i>Than whom</i>” is generally accepted as permissible&mdash;probably
because the sentence where it occurs can
not be mended without reconstruction, and it has
abundant literary authority.</p>

<p><b>that</b>: In construing this word, it must be recollected
that it is not only a conjunction but also a pronoun,
both demonstrative and relative. The peculiarity
of the word is such that it can be used more times in
succession than any other word in the English language.
Exception having been taken to a certain
“that” found in a school-boy’s exercise, it was shown
that that <i>that</i> that that boy used was right. Dean
Alford constructed a sentence on these lines which
contained no fewer than nine <i>thats</i> in succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p><i>That</i> used adverbially is wholly inexcusable. “He
was <i>that</i> sick” could only be tolerated if an ellipsis
such as “he was (to) <i>that</i> (degree) sick,” could be
supposed, but this is more than can be done; and the
expression is therefore regarded as an unpardonable
vulgarism. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#as_that">AS, THAT</a></span> (p. 22).</p>

<p><b>that there</b>: An illiterate expression commonly used
with the mistaken idea that the use of “there” adds
emphasis to what follows, as, “<i>That there</i> man.” Say,
rather, “That man there” or simply, and preferably
“That man.”</p>

<p><a id="that_who"></a><b>that</b>, <b>who</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. <i>That</i> implies restriction; <i>who</i> generally denotes
coordination. As an illustration of this distinction,
Alfred Ayres says (“The Verbalist,” p. 202),
“‘I met the boatman <i>who</i> took me across the ferry.’
If <i>who</i> is the proper word here, the meaning is ‘I
met the boatman, and he took me across the ferry,’
it being supposed that the boatman is known and
definite. But if there be several boatmen, and I wish
to indicate one in particular, by the circumstance that
he had taken me across the ferry, I should use <i>that</i>.”
<i>That</i> ought, therefore, to be preferred to <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>
whenever an antecedent not otherwise limited is to
be restricted by the relative clause.</p>

<p><b>that’s him</b>; No, “that’s <i>he</i>”&mdash;this is correct.</p>

<p><b>the</b>: Before titles of honor, such as Reverend, Honorable,
the definite article (though now frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
omitted) should be used. As the title is specific and
personal, this is the more necessary.</p>

<p><b>the infinitive</b>: The particle <i>to</i> is an inherent and
component part of the infinitive, and is strictly inseparable
therefrom, in precisely the same way that
the prefixed syllable which assists to form a compound
word (as <i>in</i>constant) is a necessary part of the compound.
But this <i>to</i> belongs to the present infinitive
only, and properly finds no place in such expressions
as “He was fool enough <i>to have risked</i> his good
name.” Despite the hundreds of uses of this method
of expression, it is a blunder: the sentence should
read “fool enough <i>to risk</i>.” It is, too, on the
ground of inseparability that the <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#split_or_cleft_infinitive">SPLIT INFINITIVE</a></span>
(which see) is so reprehensible. “To dance gracefully”
should not be transposed into “to gracefully
dance.”</p>

<p><b>them</b>: The use of this word as a demonstrative
adjective for a pronoun is wholly unpermissible. A
common error due to a desire to designate particularly
the article required. Do not say “Give me <i>them</i>
things”; say, rather, “... <i>those</i> things.”
However, of things previously mentioned one may
say “Give <i>them</i> to me.”</p>

<p><b>then</b>: The use of this word as an adjective, as in
the phrase “the <i>then</i> Bishop of York,” has been questioned;
but the usage is expressive and convenient,
and is supported by good literary authority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="thence"></a>thence</b>, <b>whence</b>: As these words mean “from
there,” “from where,” they should not be preceded
by the word <i>from</i> as is often erroneously done.</p>

<p><b>these is</b>, <b>them are</b>: Ungrammatical phrases used
by the illiterate for “this is”; “those are.” The
pronouns should both agree in number with the verb
they govern.</p>

<p><b>these kind</b>, <b>those sort</b>, <b>etc.</b>: Such expressions,
though common, are now usually considered altogether
wrong. Nouns in the singular require demonstrative
adjectives also in the singular. But <i>this</i> may
be used instead of <i>these</i> in collective expressions, such
as “this ten years.” Yet Shakespeare has many instances
of this use. Thus, in “Twelfth Night”
(act i, sc. 5) he writes “<i>these</i> kind of fools,” and in
“King Lear” (act ii, sc. 2) a precisely similar expression,
“<i>these</i> kind of knaves.” In “Othello”
(act iii, sc. 3) he has, “<i>these</i> are a kind of men.”</p>

<p><b>think, don’t</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#dont_believe_dont_think">DON’T BELIEVE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>this or that much</b>: Not elegant perhaps, but still
correct or at least passable. A careful speaker would
prefer to say “this much,” because <i>much</i> being an
adjective of quality requires, for its elucidation, not
a pronoun but an adverb. It is true that in the expression
“this” or “that much,” the word “much”
could generally, if not always, be omitted without
affecting the correctness of the sentence wherein it is
used; still the sense would not be precisely the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
“This <i>much</i> I know” denotes a limitation in the extent
of knowledge which is not restricted by “this I
know.”</p>

<p><b>threatening</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#eminent">EMINENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>three first, the</b>: Incorrect for the <i>first three</i>: one
may, however, correctly use three first if referring to
a race, or the like, in which three of the competitors
run a dead heat. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#two_first">TWO FIRST</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>through</b>: An undesirable colloquialism for “at an
end”; “finished”; generally applied to speakers
who have completed an address, or to diners who
have finished a meal. Both applications are marks
of ill-breeding and border on vulgarity.</p>

<p><b>tickled to death</b>: An absurd phrase used to express
“greatly pleased.”</p>

<p><b>till</b>: In some parts of the United States oddly misused
for <i>by</i>; as, “I’ll be there till [<i>by</i>] ten o’clock.”</p>

<p><b>time</b>: Avoid such an incongruity as “Heaps of
<i>time</i>.” “Plenty of <i>time</i>,” or “<i>time</i> enough” are to
be preferred.</p>

<p><b>timely</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#seasonable">SEASONABLE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>tinker’s dam</b>: A colloquialism for something worthless,
used usually in the phrase “Not worth a tinker’s
dam.” Avoided in polite society.</p>

<p><b>tiny little</b>: The use of words as mere intensives
should be avoided, for by judicious selection a single
word can probably be found which is capable of conveying
the precise sense desired. To speak of a “<i>tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
little</i> watch” or “a <i>great big</i> house,” indicates a
deplorable poverty of vocabulary. It is true that
Shakespeare spoke of “the <i>most unkindest</i> cut of all”;
but he made use of intensives only when the unusual
circumstances of the case required them.</p>

<p><b><a id="tired_to_make_one"></a>tired, to make one</b>: A colloquialism for “to weary,”
or “reduce the patience of” as by absurd stories or
silly conversation: a commonplace expression good to
avoid.</p>

<p><b>to</b>: Beware of using the preposition <i>to</i> when <i>at</i> is
intended. A common error of this sort is instanced
by “He was <i>to</i> school this morning.” Possibly the
error is made rather in the verb than the preposition,
though the influencing cause of error in the uneducated
does not always admit of certainty. We
suggest, therefore, that the verb “to be” is used
unintentionally for “to go,” and that the sentence is
perhaps intended to read “he <i>went to</i> school this
morning.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#and_to">AND</a></span>; <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#for_and_to">FOR</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="togged_out_or_up"></a>togged out or up</b>: An undesirable and vulgar expression
for “well-dressed” or “attired in clothes that
may attract attention.”</p>

<p><b>to-morrow</b>: This word is often used with different
tenses, the question being raised as to whether it
should be “to-morrow <i>is</i> Christmas day” or “to-morrow
<i>will be</i> Christmas day.” Both forms are correct.
But, generally, in using this word, the supposition
is that to-morrow has not arrived at the time of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
speaking, and, therefore, “to-morrow <i>will be</i> Christmas
day” is preferred. Longfellow (<i>Keramos</i>, line
331) says: “To-morrow <i>will be</i> another day.” But
the other form also has the sanction of usage, as the
following quotations will show:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To-morrow, what delight <i>is</i> in to-morrow!”&mdash;<span class="smcap">T.
B. Read</span>, <i>The New Pastoral</i>, bk. vi. l. 163.</p>

<p>“To-morrow <i>is</i> a satire on to-day.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Young</span>, <i>The
Old Man’s Relapse</i>, l. 6.</p></div>

<p>The Bible affords numerous instances of this use of
“is.” Ex. xvi. 23: “The Lord hath said, to-morrow
<i>is</i> the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord”; xxxii.
5: “And Aaron made proclamation and said, to-morrow
<i>is</i> a feast to the Lord”; I Sam. xx. 5: “Behold
to-morrow <i>is</i> the new moon”; Matt. vi. 30: “If
God so clothe the grass of the field, which to-day <i>is</i>,
and to-morrow <i>is</i> cast into the oven.”</p>

<p>Most people would say “Yesterday <i>was</i> Friday.”
If the thought is fixed upon the name of the day, it is
better to use <i>is</i>, if upon the time future it is better to
use <i>will be</i>.</p>

<p><b>toney</b>: A vulgarism for “fancy” or “stylish,”
either of which is a preferable term.</p>

<p><b>touch, to</b>: A slang term for “to borrow” not
used by persons careful of their diction. Do not say
“I touched him for a ten-spot”; say rather, “I borrowed
ten dollars from him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p><b><a id="transpire"></a>transpire</b> is condemned by the best writers in the
sense of <i>happen</i>. “The verb <i>transpire</i> formerly conveyed
very expressively its correct meaning, viz., to
become known through unnoticed channels&mdash;to exhale,
as it were, into publicity through invisible pores,
like a vapor or gas disengaging itself. But of late,
a practise has commenced of employing the word
... as a mere synonym to <i>to happen</i>....
This vile specimen of bad English is already seen in
the dispatches of noblemen and viceroys.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mill</span>,

<p><b>truth</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#veracity">VERACITY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>try</b>: This word is often erroneously used for
“make.” Do not say “<i>Try</i> the experiment yourself”
but “<i>Make</i> the experiment.” An experiment can
only be tried, as a speech (in its literal, that is verbal,
sense) can only be spoken.</p>

<p><b>try and</b>: A common but incorrect locution. Do
not say “Try and come to-day,” but, rather, “<i>Try to</i>
come to-day.”</p>

<p><b>tumble to</b>: Slang for “to understand.” Do not
say “Do you tumble to it?” Say, rather, “Do you
understand it?”</p>

<p><b>turn down</b>: Undesirable, though perhaps expressive
slang for “reject”; “ignore”; or “dismiss.”
In commercial circles, this expression has wide usage
but is not the less inelegant and should be avoided.
A proposition is quite as fully disposed of when it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
“rejected” as when it is “turned down;” besides,
“rejected” should be given preference if only by reason
of its brevity.</p>

<p><b>turn up</b>: Used in the sense of to “put in an appearance”
this expression has been condemned. The
remark of a barrister in a London County Court that
a defendant had “not turned up” caused the Judge
to exclaim: “Pray do not use such slip-shod expressions.”
The barrister apologized. “These are high-pressure
days,” he said, “and since your Honor’s
days at the bar we have no longer time to indulge
in perfect English.”</p>

<p><b>twenty-three</b>: A slang term used as the equivalent
of “fade away” in theatrical and sporting circles: a
recent expression the origin of which has been variously
explained. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#fade_away">FADE AWAY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>two</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#couple">COUPLE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>two and two is</b> (or <b>are</b>) <b>four</b>: As an abstract proposition
or statement, <i>is</i> is undoubtedly correct; for
four <i>is</i> two added to two, or twice two; but when two
specific things are added to two others, the verb must
be in the plural. In the former case we are saying
that a certain single and definite result <i>is</i> attained or
total given by the combination of two numbers; in
the latter we say that in a given body or number of
things <i>are</i> so many single or individual things. Two
<i>men</i> and two <i>are</i> undoubtedly four; that is, four men
<i>are</i> (constituted of) two and two. Beyond doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
twice one <i>is</i> two; for it can not be that two (as a single
and specific number) are twice one.</p>

<p><b><a id="two_first"></a>two first</b>: Of this expression James Murdock says:
“The only argument against the use of <i>two first</i>, and
in favor of substituting <i>first two</i>, so far as I can recollect,
is this: In the nature of things, there can be
only <i>one first</i> and <i>one last</i>, in any series of things.
But&mdash;is it true that there can never be more than <i>one
first</i> and <i>one last</i>? If it be so, then the adjective <i>first</i>
and <i>last</i> must always be of the <i>singular</i> number, and
can never agree with nouns in the plural. We are
told that <i>the first years</i> of a lawyer’s practise are seldom
very lucrative. The poet tells us that his <i>first
essays</i> were severely handled by the critics, but his
<i>last efforts</i> have been well received. Examples like
these might be produced without number. They occur
everywhere in all our standard writers....
When a numeral adjective and a qualifying epithet
both refer to the same noun, the <i>general rule</i> of the
English language is to place the numeral first, then
the qualifying epithet, and afterwards the noun.
Thus we say, ‘The <i>two wise</i> men,’ ‘the <i>two tall</i> men’;
and not ‘the <i>wise two</i> men’ ‘the <i>tall two</i> men.’ And
the same rule holds in <i>superlatives</i>. We say ‘the <i>two
wisest</i> men,’ ‘the <i>two tallest</i> men’ and not ‘the <i>wisest
two</i> men,’ ‘the <i>tallest two</i> men.’ Now if this be admitted
to be the general rule of the English language,
it then follows that we should generally say ‘the <i>two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
first</i>,’ ‘the <i>two last</i>,’ etc., rather than ‘the <i>first two</i>,’
‘the <i>last two</i>,’ etc. This, I say, should <i>generally</i> be
the order of the words. Yet there are some cases in
which it seems preferable to say, ‘the <i>first two</i>,’ ‘the
<i>first three</i>,’ etc.” Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#first">FIRST</a></span>.</p>




<h2>U </h2>


<p><b>ugly</b>, which signifies the reverse of beautiful or want
of comeliness (actual or figurative) is colloquially extended
in the United States to uncomeliness of character
or personal demeanor; as an <i>ugly</i> fellow; an
<i>ugly</i> beast; anger makes him <i>ugly</i>. In polite speech
this usage is not sanctioned. Say “irritable,”
“vicious,” “quarrelsome,” as the disposition inclines
or indicates.</p>

<p><b>un-</b>: For the sake of lucidity the use of a negative
prefix with a negative antecedent should be discouraged.
Avoid such expressions as “He spoke in <i>no
un</i>mistakable terms” which means, of course, “mistakable
terms” the direct opposite of the speaker’s
intention. “<i>Not</i> an <i>un</i>kempt one among them”
means that all were well kempt.</p>

<p><b>unbeknown</b>: A vulgar provincialism used chiefly
in the form <i>unbeknownst</i>.</p>

<p><b>uncommon</b>: Used for <i>uncommonly</i>: a vulgarism
meaning “to an unusual degree or extremely.” Do
not say “Her eyes are <i>uncommon</i> beautiful”; say,
rather, “... <i>uncommonly</i> beautiful.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p><b>unconscionable</b>: When used for <i>unconscionably</i> is
a bad provincialism. Used also by the illiterate instead
of <i>uncommonly</i>; as, “She is an <i>unconscionable</i>
handsome girl”&mdash;this is bad English.</p>

<p><b>under</b>: Much philological nonsense has been written
in disapproval of the expression “<i>under</i> his signature,”
for which “over his signature”&mdash;that “preposterous
conceit,” as Gould aptly terms it&mdash;is suggested
as a substitute. But it is clear that the expression
is elliptical, and means “under sanction or authority
of his signature.” “<i>Under</i> oath” is good enough to
impress upon an unwilling and prevaricating witness
the distinction between perjury and a lie, and that
although he does not physically lie <i>under</i> the oath.</p>

<p><b>understand</b> should not be used as an expletive with
interrogatory inflection, as a contraction of “<i>Do you
understand?</i>” There is no excuse for this nor for its
objectionable iteration. Avoid such absurdities as:
“Grammar, <i>understand</i>, is the science that treats of
the principles, <i>understand</i>, that govern the correct use
of language,” etc. <i>See</i> is also misused in the same
manner.</p>

<p><b>unique</b>: As this word implies “being the only one
of its kind” it should never be preceded by “very”
which implies degree. On this subject the <span class="smcap">Standard
Dictionary</span> says: “We may say <i>quite unique</i> if we
mean absolutely singular or without parallel but we
can not properly say <i>very unique</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p><b>United States</b>: Under this designation the several
states comprising the American Union are known collectively
as one great nation. As such the expression
is singular and accordingly is correctly followed by
a verb in the singular.</p>

<p><b><a id="universally_by_all"></a>universally by all</b>: A common error. Where anything
is done <i>universally</i>, it must be done <i>by all</i>, and
these words being redundant should be omitted.</p>

<p><b>universe</b> should not be used where <i>earth</i> is intended.
If one desires to say of a certain person that he “thinks
he owns the <i>earth</i>,” one should certainly be careful to
limit his vast possessions and not extend them to the
<i>universe</i>. The latter embraces all comprised in space.
“No doubt, there is a <i>universe</i>; but the word means
all created things, as a whole; not only our entire
solar system, but all the other systems of which the
fixed stars are but the centres.”&mdash;<span class="smcap">E. S. Gould</span>, <i>Good
English, Misused Words</i>, p. 83.</p>

<p><b>unless</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#without">WITHOUT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>unwell</b>, owing to its common euphemistic application,
should not be used for “ill.”</p>

<p><b><a id="up"></a>up</b>: In general the word <i>up</i>, used in such a phrase
as “Open up” or “He <i>opened up</i> his sermon with a
parable” is redundant and should be omitted. Compare
<span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#open_up">OPEN</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>up against it</b>: A colloquial expression used as the
equivalent of “face to face with” some condition or
thing, usually of a discouraging or disastrous char<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>acter.
Though common in commercial circles it is
an expression that it is best to avoid.</p>

<p><b>upon</b>: Often used for <i>on</i> in such phrases as “call
<i>upon</i>,” whether meaning <i>visit</i> or <i>summon</i> and “speak
(or write) <i>upon</i>.” The reasonable tendency now is
to use the simpler <i>on</i> whenever the idea of superposition
is not involved.</p>

<p><b>usage</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#habit">HABIT</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>use</b>: This word is used in all sorts of incorrect and
inelegant ways; yet the conjugation of the verb is
positive and very simple&mdash;<i>use</i>; <i>used</i>; <i>using</i>.
There appears to be no difficulty in applying it affirmatively
but when used in a negative form one often
hears such uncouth expressions as “You <i>didn’t use</i>
to,” “you <i>hadn’t used</i> to” instead of “You used not
to,” etc. It need scarcely be said that these expressions
are vulgarisms of the worst type. “I usedn’t
to” is not pretty, but is less formal than “I used not
to,” and can not be objected to on grammatical
grounds.</p>

<p><b>usually</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#commonly">COMMONLY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b><a id="utter"></a>utter</b> as a verb should be distinguished from <i>say</i>,
as articulate expression is differentiated from written.
To <i>utter</i>, save in the legal sense, is to emit audibly.
Adjectively the word can be used only in an unfavorable
sense for “complete.” <i>Utter</i> discord there may
be, but <i>not</i> utter harmony; <i>utter</i> silence, but <i>not</i> utter
speech.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>




<h2>V </h2>


<p><b>vain</b>, <b>vein</b>: Words of similar pronunciation whose
spelling is sometimes confused by the careless. <i>Vein</i>
is the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vena</i>, blood-vessel, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">veho</i>, carry, and
is therefore totally distinct from <i>vain</i>, which is from
the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vanus</i>, empty.</p>

<p><b>valuable</b> is occasionally misused for <i>valued</i>. <i>Valuable</i>
is said correctly only of things that have monetary
value or derive worth as from their character or
quality. One may have <i>valued</i> friends and <i>valuable</i>
art-treasures, but <i>not</i> valuable friends nor valued art-treasures.</p>

<p><b>venal</b>, <b>venial</b>: Discriminate carefully between these
words. One who is <i>venal</i> is ready to sell his influence
or efforts for some consideration from sordid motives;
he is mercenary. But one who is <i>venial</i> has committed
only a slight or trivial fault. A man who has
sold his vote for preferment is a <i>venal</i> politician; a
starving man who has stolen a loaf of bread for his
family has been guilty of a <i>venial</i> offense.</p>

<p><b>ventilate</b> should not be used for “expose” or “explain.”</p>

<p><b><a id="veracity"></a>veracity</b>, <b>truth</b>: Do not confound these words.
<i>Truth</i> is applied to persons and facts; <i>veracity</i> only
to persons and to statements made by them. One
should not speak of the <i>veracity</i> of anything that has
occurred. A man of integrity may have a reputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
for <i>veracity</i>; if so, there is no doubt that he told the
<i>truth</i> or that the account he gave was <i>true</i>.</p>

<p><b>verbal nouns</b>, especially such as could be replaced
by a noun pure and simple, etymologically coordinate,
should be preceded by a possessive in sentences of
this character: “The cause of Henry (<i>’s</i>) dying was
appendicitis.” <i>Dying</i> is here equivalent to <i>death</i>;
and we should (if we substituted the pronoun) certainly
say “the cause of <i>his</i> dying” rather than “the
cause of <i>him</i> dying.”</p>

<p><b>verse</b>: The chief meaning of this word is a single
line of poetry; sometimes it is used as a synonym for
<i>stanza</i>. Some grammarians advocate the use of <i>verse</i>
instead of <i>stanza</i>, and the familiar character of the
word seems to argue in favor of this use.</p>

<p><b>very</b>: Excepting where a participle is used solely
as an adjective, it is now thought to be more grammatical
to interpose an adverb between the participle
and this word. Thus, “<i>very greatly</i> dissatisfied” is
preferred to “very dissatisfied,” whereas “<i>very</i> tired”
is accepted as correct. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#real">REAL</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>vest</b>: In the sense of waistcoat, this word, which
is in better usage a synonym for <i>undervest</i>, is not used
by precise speakers.</p>

<p><b>vice</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#crime">CRIME</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>vicinity</b> should not be used for “neighborhood.”</p>

<p><b>visit</b>: A term sometimes misused. Do not say
“The actor has just <i>visited</i>, with much abuse, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
head of the critic,” when you mean that he abused
him roundly. This is an erroneous application of the
word, which is confounded with the Scriptural usage
“to send judgment from heaven upon” as punishment.</p>

<p><b>vocation</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#avocation">AVOCATION</a></span>.</p>




<h2>W </h2>


<p><b>wa’n’t</b>: A contraction of <i>was not</i>, or improperly of
<i>were not</i>; as, “He <i>wa’n’t</i> (or they <i>wa’n’t</i>) at home”:
a common vulgarism.</p>

<p><b>want</b> and <b>need</b> are not synonymous terms, although
both denote a lack. <i>Want</i>, however, refers more
properly to a personal conception of shortcoming or
shortage, whereas <i>need</i> denotes the matter of fact.
Thus a delinquent son may <i>need</i> castigation, while
he distinctly does not <i>want</i> it. <i>Want</i>, therefore, signifies
a wish to supply what is lacking. But the word
<i>want</i> is sometimes less strong than <i>need</i>, for a covetous
man <i>wants</i> (<i>i. e.</i>, desires) many things he does not
<i>need</i> (or things for which he has an absolute necessity).
“I <i>need</i> assistance or I shall drown.” Again,
“I <i>want</i> a position, but do not <i>need</i> it, because I
can continue as I am without it; but when resources
fail I shall <i>need</i> it.”</p>

<p><b>want of</b>: An undesirable colloquialism. Do not
say “What does he <i>want of</i> a yacht?” say, rather.
<i>want with</i>, or “<i>What need</i> has he <i>of</i> a yacht?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p><b>warm</b>: A slang term used for “rich,” formerly in
vogue in England.</p>

<p><b>warm, not so</b>: A vulgar phrase applied to persons
and meaning usually “not as important” or “not as
accurate” as the person to whom the epithet is applied
may think himself to be.</p>

<p><b>was</b>, <b>is</b>: These terms are sometimes confused, especially
in dependent sentences that state unchanging
facts. Then <i>the present tense</i> should be used in the
dependent sentence notwithstanding the fact that the
principal verb may denote action in <i>the past</i>. Say,
“He <i>said</i> that space <i>is</i> (<i>not</i> was) infinite”; “We
<i>assert</i> that life <i>is</i> everlasting.”</p>

<p><b>watch</b>, <b>observe</b>: These words have a similarity of
meaning, but <i>watch</i> expresses a scrutiny or close observation
which is not implied by the latter. You
<i>observe</i> a preacher’s manner but carefully <i>watch</i> a
thief. When you <i>observe</i> intently and concentrate your
entire thoughts upon the thing observed you <i>watch</i>.
You <i>observe</i> the hour of day but <i>watch</i> the time
lest you lose your train.</p>

<p><b>way</b> or <b>’way</b>, as an abbreviation of the adverb <i>away</i>,
as “<i>’way</i> out West,” is an impropriety of speech.
Say, rather, “He has gone (or is in the) West.”</p>

<p><b>ways</b>, for <b>way</b>: In the sense of “space or distance,”
the erroneous form <i>ways</i>, for <i>way</i>, is often
used colloquially, perhaps originally through confusion
with the suffix <i>-ways</i>; as, “The church is a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
<i>ways</i> from here,” which should be “The church is a
long <i>way</i>,” etc.</p>

<p><b>weary</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#tired_to_make_one">TIRED</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>weather, under the</b>: In the sense of “somewhat
ill,” as though depressed by the weather, this is a
colloquialism better avoided.</p>

<p><b><a id="went"></a>went</b>: This word should never be used as a participle;
say, “He <i>went</i>” or “he has <i>gone</i>” instead of
“he <i>has went</i>.” Never use <i>went</i> after any part of
the verb <i>have</i>. Do not say “I <i>have went</i> there
often”; but “I <i>have been</i> there often.” <i>Went</i> should
never be used for <i>go</i>. Some illiterate people say “I
should <i>have went</i>” when they mean “I should <i>have
gone</i>.”</p>

<p><b>were her</b>: Often used incorrectly as in the sentence
“If I were <i>her</i>.” Say, rather, “If I were <i>she</i>.” Her
is the objective case; here the nominative <i>she</i> should
be used.</p>

<p><b>wharf</b>: E. S. Gould declares that as <i>dwarves</i>
would be an improper plural for dwarf, so is <i>wharves</i>
for wharf. However, both forms are now admitted.
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#dock">DOCK</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>what</b>: As <i>what</i> is both antecedent and relative the
use of the antecedent with this word is wrong. “All
<i>what</i> he said was false” should be corrected by the
elision of “all.” <i>What</i> is used only in reference to
things, whereas <i>that</i> can be said of persons, animals,
and things, and can be substituted for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p><b>what was</b>, <b>what was not</b>: “What was” and “what
wasn’t my surprise” may both be used correctly to
express considerable surprise, and with almost the
same meaning, the one expression differing from the
other but by a shade in sense. “How great was my
surprise,” and “What surprise could equal or be
greater, than mine,” would about paraphrase the
usages. The former sentence implies great surprise,
but the possibility (though unreferred to) of a greater;
the latter indicates that there could not be any greater
surprise.</p>

<p><b>wheels in the</b> (or <b>his</b>) <b>head, to have</b>: A slang phrase
used as a substitute for “to be eccentric, peculiar,
or erratic.”</p>

<p><b>whence</b>: “<i>Whence</i> came you” is sufficient and
correct. “From <i>whence</i>” is pleonastic, the <i>whence</i>
being nothing less than “<i>from</i> where” and thus including
the <i>from</i>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#thence">THENCE</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>where</b>: The prepositions <i>to</i> or <i>at</i> should never end
a sentence beginning with <i>where</i>. Such use is vulgar
and illiterate. Avoid: “<i>Where</i> has he gone <i>to</i>?”
“<i>Where</i> was I <i>at</i>?”</p>

<p><b>whereabouts</b>: This word, plural in form, but singular
in construction, always takes a verb, in the
singular. “Husband and wife disappeared; their
whereabouts <i>is</i> a mystery.”</p>

<p><b>wherever</b>: This word, although a combination of
two words “where” and “ever” is not spelt “where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
ever” when written as a solid word. Then it drops
the first “e” in “ever” and is correctly “wherever.”</p>

<p><b><a id="whether"></a>whether</b>: Avoid such a locution as “whether or no,”
which is rapidly gaining ground, and say instead the
preferable phrase, “whether or not.” <i>Whether</i> properly
means “which of two.” Therefore, in expressing
doubt, make mention merely of the exact thing
doubted without using the word <i>whether</i> unless it be to
introduce an alternative subject of doubt or a comparison
of doubts. Just as <i>either</i>, which is strictly applicable
to two only is wrongly applied to more than two,
so is <i>whether</i>, which is a contraction of <i>which of either</i>.</p>

<p><b>which</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#that_who">THAT, WHO</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>who</b>: Often improperly used for <i>whom</i>: a mark of
ignorance when so applied. Do not say “<i>Who</i> do you
refer to?” but “To <i>whom</i> do you refer?” Not “<i>Who</i>
is that for?” nor “Who did you give it to?” but
“For <i>whom</i> is that?” “To <i>whom</i> did you give it?”
Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#that_who">THAT, WHO</a></span>.</p>

<p><a id="whole_whole_of"></a><b>whole</b>, <b>whole of</b>: The <i>whole</i> or <i>whole of</i> should be
used before a plural noun carefully, and then only
when the body is referred to collectively. In general
the word <i>entire</i> would better express the phrase. In
such cases <i>all</i> should never be employed, as this relates
to the individual of which the body is composed.
Thus, one may say, “The <i>whole</i> staff accompanied the
general,” or (for emphasis) “The <i>whole of</i> the staff,”
etc., but it would be better to say “The <i>entire</i> staff.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>If referring to the individual officers, the sentence
should read “<i>All</i> members of the staff accompanied
the general.”</p>

<p><b>whole push, the</b>. See <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#push_the_whole">PUSH</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>widow woman</b>: A pleonasm. Do not use the
word <i>widow</i>, which applies only to a woman, with the
words <i>woman</i> or <i>lady</i>. It is an error of speech, common
in rural districts, against which it is wise to continually
guard.</p>

<p><b>wife</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#lady">LADY</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>wild</b>: A colloquialism for “angry” which is to be
preferred.</p>

<p><b><a id="windbag"></a>windbag</b>: A coarse term for a boastful and wordy
talker: not used by persons who cultivate a refined
diction. “Braggart,” “braggadocia,” are more elegant,
yet equally expressive terms.</p>

<p><a id="with_and"></a><b>with</b>, <b>and</b>: A nominative singular is sometimes used
with an objective after <i>with</i> to form, jointly, the subject
of a plural verb; as “The captain <i>with</i> all his crew
<i>were</i> drowned.” But according to best usage the conjunction
<i>and</i> is substituted for “with”; thus, “The
captain <i>and</i> all his crew <i>were</i> drowned.” Where the
objective is separated parenthetically by commas, a
verb in the singular is used; as, “Aguinaldo, with all
his followers, <i>was</i> captured by Gen. Funston.”</p>

<p><b><a id="without"></a>without</b>: This, as used for “except” or “unless”
is at the present day a vulgarism. “<i>Without</i> you intend
business, do not call”; say, <i>unless</i>.</p>

<p><b>worse</b>: An adverb sometimes used for <i>more</i>; as,
“He disliked tea <i>worse</i> than coffee”: a vulgarism.</p>

<p><b>worst kind</b>: For <i>much</i> or <i>extremely</i>; as, “I need
(or want) a new pen the <i>worst kind</i>”: a vulgarism, besides
equivocally suggesting “the worst kind of a pen.”</p>

<p><b>would better</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#had_better_would_better">HAD BETTER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>would say</b>: A hackneyed expression used by many
commercial correspondents; inelegant and useless.</p>

<p><b>would seem</b> should not be used for “seems.”</p>

<p><b>wrath</b>. Compare <span class="smcap lowercase"><a href="#temper">TEMPER</a></span>.</p>

<p><b>write you</b>: This expression, for “write to you,”
though common, is not grammatically correct. Where
an object is expressed the dative “to” may be omitted.
“He shipped <i>me</i> costly fabrics,” for “he shipped
costly fabrics to <i>me</i>” is permissible, but “he shipped
<i>me</i>” without any objective, or rather other objective
of <i>me</i> would imply that the person speaking had been
shipped. Of the expression “I will write you,” the
only justification for it that can be found is in the
supposition that the words “a letter” are understood.</p>




<h2>Y </h2>


<p><b>yappy</b>: A slang term used as an equivalent of
“foolish” which is to be preferred.</p>

<p><b>yes</b>: Discard such vulgarisms as <i>yeh</i> and <i>yep</i> and
pronounce as a single syllable, and not with affecta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>tion,
as, sometimes in England <i>ya-as</i>, or with a Yankee
drawl <i>ye-es</i>. Avoid, too, the objectionable habit of
using this word as the sole response in conversation;
a habit which is indeed fatally destructive of conversation,
which should partake more or less of an interchange
of ideas. “Yes! she would reply encouragingly
... and yes! conclusively, like an
incarnation of stupidity dealing in monosyllables.”
(<span class="smcap">Meredith</span>, “Beauchamp’s Career,” vol. iii. ch. 10,
p. 185.) Also, when speaking in English do not inject
the German “Ja!” when you wish to signify assent.
This practice is rapidly gaining ground among the
middle class.</p>

<p><b>Yid</b>: A Jew: an appellation common among the
vulgar and therefore one to be avoided.</p>

<p><b>you</b> even when used in relation to one person, is
still grammatically plural, always requiring the plural
verb; as, “You <i>were</i> fortunate,” not “You <i>was</i> fortunate”;
“If you <i>were</i> to curse you would sin,” not
“If you <i>was</i> to curse,” etc.</p>

<p><b><a id="you_and_I"></a>you and I</b>, <b>you or I</b>: Phrases in which the objective
pronoun <i>me</i> and the first personal pronoun <i>I</i> are often
confused; as, “This will not do for <i>you and I</i>,” instead
of “This will not do for <i>you and me</i>.’” The
rule is very simple, viz.: use <i>I</i> or <i>me</i> in such connection
just as if the words “you and” or “you or” were
omitted. “They were not citizens as (<i>you and</i>) <i>I</i>”;
“He is not so tall as (<i>you or</i>) <i>I</i>.”</p>

pronoun does not need the sign of the possessive
after it.</p>




<h2>Z </h2>


<p><b>zeugma</b>: “Is the joining of two or more words (as

in English quite unusual and ordinarily a violation of
the principles of construction and a grave fault in
